10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,729
PROFESSOR: How you guys doing?

11
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:36,620
I don't know.

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,329
As Nickolai said,
thanks for inviting us.

13
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,453
It's a real pleasure to
come here and have a chance

14
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:41,680
to talk to everybody today.

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,638
I brought one of
my senior managers

16
00:00:43,638 --> 00:00:46,360
who oversees the network and
security areas, Dave LaPorte,

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,933
who's going to talk
about some of the more

18
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:50,224
tactical details of what we do.

19
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,615
I'm going to talk
about the high level.

20
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:54,446
Feel free to ask
questions at any time.

21
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:56,571
So really your opportunity
free to ask any anything

22
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:57,510
you're curious about.

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:00,686
So there's no decorum in terms
of what you guys may ask,

24
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:03,470
at anytime feel free to engage.

25
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,226
And so I think I was sitting
where you guys are sitting--

26
00:01:07,226 --> 00:01:09,218
I don't know-- it's
almost 20 years ago now?

27
00:01:09,218 --> 00:01:09,716
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

28
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:11,040
PROFESSOR: [CHUCKLES]
So Nickolai and I

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,190
were a lot younger then.

30
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,870
And I was probably a
lot thinner by then

31
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,800
and had a little bit more hair.

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,160
You know, one of the nice
things about overseeing

33
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,840
MIT's infrastructure
and operations areas,

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,061
you can see all sorts
of interesting things.

35
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,560
And some of the things we'll
talk about, a lot of what we do

36
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,510
is dealing with
interesting problems.

37
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:32,230
And you know, there's
no shortage of things

38
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:33,620
in an environment like MIT's.

39
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,390
I think what's
really remarkable is

40
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,490
we run an open network, which
is a little bit of a good thing

41
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:40,730
and a bad thing.

42
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:43,374
We don't have a broad campus
firewall, for the most part.

43
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:44,790
And everything's
pretty much open.

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,320
If you guys want to run a
computer in your dorm, right

45
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,240
here in the lecture
hall, or anything else,

46
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,823
you have pretty much
unfettered access

47
00:01:50,823 --> 00:01:53,940
to the internet, which is,
compared to other schools,

48
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,255
actually, fairly unusual.

49
00:01:55,255 --> 00:01:57,380
You know, you may not
realize that as you sit here,

50
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,910
but that's not the norm.

51
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,970
And that brings with it a
whole slew of challenges,

52
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,052
in terms of keeping
things secure.

53
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:08,258
So pretty much, we're
wide open to the world.

54
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,689
And that means
anybody, anywhere,

55
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,051
from whatever country, from
whatever part of the planet.

56
00:02:12,051 --> 00:02:14,550
If they want to reach out and
touch your device sitting here

57
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,770
in this room, as you're
sitting here today,

58
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,040
whether it's your
phone in your pocket,

59
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
or your laptop that you're
typing on when you're

60
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,740
sitting here, they can do that.

61
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,045
There's nothing to prevent
them from doing that, right?

62
00:02:23,045 --> 00:02:25,390
And that's kind of scary, right?

63
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,330
So we did an experiment
a couple of years ago.

64
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,210
And we just took a device out of
box brand new, brand new Apple

65
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,270
laptop, and just plugged it in.

66
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,550
Registered it for DHCP and just
left it there sitting there

67
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,670
for 24 hours.

68
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:44,330
And we left TCP dumps
running to just take

69
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,370
an inventory of what was
coming into the machine

70
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,280
for a 24-hour period, just
to see what we would see.

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,470
And then we combined
that with, hey,

72
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,150
let's go and graph all the
various IPs, using GeoIP lookup

73
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,440
and graphed them, put
them on Google Earth

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,840
and see what that looks like.

75
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,450
And for one 24-hour period,
for an inauspicious or relevant

76
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:07,010
host which is just publicly
registered for the internet,

77
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,920
it received connections from
every country on the earth,

78
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,240
except for two.

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,650
In one 24-hour period, one host,
every country, except for two.

80
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,150
That's pretty startling, right?

81
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,110
Does anybody want
to take a guess what

82
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,390
the two countries that
were not trying to connect

83
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,002
to this machine were?

84
00:03:24,002 --> 00:03:24,918
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

85
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:25,350
AUDIENCE: North Korea.

86
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,220
PROFESSOR: Anyone?

87
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,590
North Korea is one.

88
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,590
Good.

89
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,090
Nope.

90
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,015
China was very
actively represented.

91
00:03:31,015 --> 00:03:32,075
[LAUGHTER]

92
00:03:32,075 --> 00:03:34,200
So might have been the
military part, I don't know,

93
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,190
but certainly was very
actively represented.

94
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,460
AUDIENCE: Antarctica.

95
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,459
PROFESSOR: That's right.

96
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:40,086
Antarctica.

97
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:41,512
Very good.

98
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,970
So you get the gold
star for today.

99
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,400
It's excellent.

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:44,900
Yeah.

101
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,020
Yeah.

102
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,260
And so, for one
24-hour period, you're

103
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,200
seeing yourself subjected to
potential attacks, threats,

104
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,985
malware, anything
else everywhere.

105
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,820
For one host.

106
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,540
And the entire MIT campus right
now compromises about, I'd say,

107
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,450
150,000 different devices.

108
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,049
And so, if you do the math--

109
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:07,090
you can do that outright.

110
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,270
You're good at
math here at MIT--

111
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,580
that's a lot of threats, right?

112
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,290
And you know that happens
all day, every day.

113
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:18,790
Right?

114
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,370
And that's pretty scary.

115
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,420
And you want to combine
that with something else

116
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,520
to make a little
bit more scared?

117
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,320
So Dave and I were sitting in a
meaning a couple of months ago.

118
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
This is kind of a follow-up
as to a power outage

119
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,110
that happened.

120
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,235
Any of you here for the
big power outage a year ago

121
00:04:34,235 --> 00:04:35,400
or a year and a half ago?

122
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,860
It was an exciting time, right?

123
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,309
[CHUCKLES FROM AUDIENCE]

124
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,600
I was here for the big power
outage about 20 years ago,

125
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,349
when the entire city
of Cambridge was out.

126
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,630
Now, that was cool.

127
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,345
Except it was about
100 degrees, so it

128
00:04:45,345 --> 00:04:46,845
was a good time to
go over to Boston

129
00:04:46,845 --> 00:04:49,242
and see a movie in
a movie theater.

130
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:50,825
But one thing that
came out of it that

131
00:04:50,825 --> 00:04:52,075
was really interesting to us--

132
00:04:52,075 --> 00:04:53,765
I don't know,
let's talk about it

133
00:04:53,765 --> 00:04:55,931
for a second-- but Facilities
department comes to us

134
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:58,615
and says, you know, this
has been really bad,

135
00:04:58,615 --> 00:04:59,510
this power outage.

136
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,600
We've really had to spend
the last four or five

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,570
months going across the
campus and reprogramming

138
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,041
all these devices.

139
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:07,540
OK.

140
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,880
Well, they must have
some SCADA systems

141
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,755
that are connected to
their air conditioning,

142
00:05:11,755 --> 00:05:14,990
or to the lights in the room,
the doors, things like that,

143
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,490
right?

144
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,490
You would think they do.

145
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,390
It's MIT.

146
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,350
Makes sense.

147
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:23,850
So sure, you imagine
they're secure.

148
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,600
Talk about that in a second.

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,900
And so we figured that was
pretty straightforward.

150
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,010
And they said one of the things
they had a problem with was

151
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,878
their devices keep
getting knocked off

152
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:37,030
the net, have these issues.

153
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,710
And the more you
start talking to them,

154
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,670
you peel back
layers of the onion.

155
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,266
You're like, what do you mean
your devices are on the net?

156
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,891
Say, well, yeah, our
devices are on the net.

157
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,390
Oh.

158
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,030
You must have some secure,
proprietary control

159
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,442
system, a control network.

160
00:05:51,442 --> 00:05:53,400
And they kind of looked
at us with a blank look

161
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,250
and were like, uh, I
think that's what it is.

162
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,280
That's what the vendor told us.

163
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,610
And this brings up one
of the interesting things

164
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,195
of the internet of
things or the era

165
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:06,237
we're moving into is, for the
most part, when I was younger,

166
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:08,695
people using the internet had
to be fairly specific, right?

167
00:06:08,695 --> 00:06:11,480
You had to fairly know
something that you were doing.

168
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,650
Today, everybody's using it.

169
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,067
And the bar to use it used to
be, when you ride the roller

170
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,816
coaster, thou shalt
be this tall if you're

171
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:19,300
going to ride this rocket.

172
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,460
It's gotten a lot
lower, all right?

173
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,050
And so through the
conversation with them,

174
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,510
we find out that they have
pretty much everything

175
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,630
you could think of
connected to the internet.

176
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:30,955
Everything.

177
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,580
One of the things
that was interesting.

178
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,996
MIT launched an
energy Initiative,

179
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,540
I don't know, five,
seven years ago,

180
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,460
when Susan Hockfield
was here as president.

181
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,959
And one of the
things Facilities did

182
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,255
was really grow the
internet of things on campus

183
00:06:42,255 --> 00:06:45,300
to create these dynamically
managed buildings.

184
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,260
So when a classroom isn't
in use, lights will go off,

185
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,230
heating will change.

186
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:49,730
It's new.

187
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,840
They're doing things like
that across the campus.

188
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,060
They deployed a gigantic
control network.

189
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:57,190
Gigantic.

190
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,570
It's actually bigger than
our own campus internet is,

191
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,070
somewhat.

192
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,830
So their control
compromises, I think,

193
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,950
400,000 different
points that they're

194
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:05,900
monitoring across the campus.

195
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,790
Over 75,000 to 100,000 places.

196
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,030
And so the next question
you ask yourself--

197
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,390
Dave asks, with the
big, bright, wide eyes

198
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,260
is, how you guys securing that?

199
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,050
They're like, well,
we called you guys up,

200
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,724
and we were going to check.

201
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:21,515
And they put it in.

202
00:07:21,515 --> 00:07:23,780
And they got an IP address
by going through a web form

203
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,420
and request an IP.

204
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,290
Requested IP, it's working.

205
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:32,560
And you know we're sitting there
going, yeah, this whole open

206
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,222
internet thing--

207
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:37,125
how are you guys securing that?

208
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,366
And the question, of
course, which is, you know,

209
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:42,110
when your blood pressure
goes up a little bit

210
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,000
was, well, it's secure, because
you guys take care of that.

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
So the security's
already taken care of.

212
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,390
And you know our look on
our face is a little bit--

213
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,650
what do you mean by secure?

214
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,164
Well, we have
corporate firewalls.

215
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:55,830
It's dealt with.

216
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,330
And everything's cool.

217
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:57,510
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]

218
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,980
And you know my
next question was,

219
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,910
can you show me where that is?

220
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,890
I don't know.

221
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,200
And you know, of
course, the response

222
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,240
was, well, everybody does.

223
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,426
And of course, we're
a little different,

224
00:08:10,426 --> 00:08:12,050
going back to the
point I made earlier,

225
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,200
we operate a fairly
open environment.

226
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,740
And we've always believed
and it's MIT's philosophy

227
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,297
that we believe in defense
and security across the stack.

228
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:24,880
You don't want to depend on any
one part of the infrastructure

229
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,635
to implement security.

230
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,844
It's something you have to
do at every layer, right?

231
00:08:27,844 --> 00:08:29,140
You don't just do it
at the infrastructure,

232
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,348
you do it at the application.

233
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:31,799
You do it all sorts of places.

234
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,049
That's not how these systems--

235
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,988
you know, the internet of things
on the SCADA side-- get built.

236
00:08:35,988 --> 00:08:38,340
You know, that's kind of scary.

237
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,469
And so one of the
things we're seeing here

238
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,760
that we deal with, so in
addition to dealing with folks

239
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,320
like yourself who
are doing all sorts

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,169
of creative and inventive things
that keep people like Dave

241
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:49,126
and I up at night.

242
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:50,500
You know, the
internet's becoming

243
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,760
this utility that's used
for all sorts of things

244
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,750
across the campus.

245
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,530
And it's really
changed the dynamics

246
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,460
that we have to worry
about, in terms of threats,

247
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,610
security issues,
all sorts of things.

248
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,340
So now, you know,
when the internet

249
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,030
used to go down or have an
issue when we were students,

250
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,102
it was an inconvenience.

251
00:09:07,102 --> 00:09:07,602
Right?

252
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:10,940
It was annoying.

253
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,790
In these most recent
types of event,

254
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,998
when the internet goes out,
people's air conditioning

255
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:15,650
stops working.

256
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,720
Your heat goes out, you know?

257
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,650
So the threats have
really changed.

258
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,201
And so for us, we deal with this
whole broad spectrum of things

259
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,450
where we operate as a service
provider for the campus,

260
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,200
providing services to
folks like yourself.

261
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,520
We also provide services
to all sorts of things.

262
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,920
And if you combine that with
our open network philosophy,

263
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,720
it creates a lot of interesting
use cases and threats

264
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,150
that we have to worry about
on a pretty persistent basis.

265
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,010
And people's expectation of how
the internet is going to work

266
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,093
and one of the things
that's also been eye opening

267
00:09:46,093 --> 00:09:48,350
is these systems kind of grow.

268
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,045
When the power
outage happened, one

269
00:09:50,045 --> 00:09:53,010
of the first questions
they had was,

270
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,680
why did the network
stop working?

271
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,375
Our response was, well,
there was no power.

272
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:02,000
And they said, well, that comes
from the batteries on the phone

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,050
system, right?

274
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,006
It's all taken care of.

275
00:10:05,006 --> 00:10:05,880
Like, no, it doesn't.

276
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,171
That's analog phone technology.

277
00:10:07,171 --> 00:10:08,930
Like, well, what's
the difference?

278
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:11,510
Well, you guys know a lot.

279
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,910
But there's this expectation
that these things operate

280
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,610
with the utility
service, whether it's

281
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,885
at the security level,
resiliency level, or everything

282
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:18,750
else.

283
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,712
And I love the folks that
have so much confidence

284
00:10:22,712 --> 00:10:24,920
that these things are being
dealt with at that level.

285
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,020
But that's a big gap from
where we are right now.

286
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,270
And so we spend a majority
of our time trying

287
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,120
to keep the campus
environment running,

288
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,790
keep everything as
secure as we can.

289
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:37,670
Dave will talk about that
in a little bit more detail.

290
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,000
He'll give you some interesting
stories about the kinds

291
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,510
of things we deal with.

292
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,700
But it's an
interesting job, right?

293
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,470
And we see all sorts
of interesting things.

294
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:49,910
And I think the problems
just get harder and harder.

295
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:53,166
And I think the thing is is
the internet kind of expands.

296
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,040
And the internet of
things is a big buzzword.

297
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,710
How many of you have heard
of that before today?

298
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,520
You guys have gone to a
Cisco website or something.

299
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,641
Trying to sell you
expensive equipment.

300
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:05,390
But this whole phenomenon
where everything

301
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,680
is internet or
IP-enabled, that's here.

302
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,580
And unfortunately, a lot of the
people writing these systems

303
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:16,194
are not as studious as
people who went to MIT.

304
00:11:16,194 --> 00:11:18,110
They create all sorts
of interesting problems.

305
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,693
So I think, for us,
the real challenge

306
00:11:19,693 --> 00:11:22,759
is, when you look at security
from a systemic level,

307
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,800
it's just there's a thousand
little bitty pieces.

308
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,350
And it's really, really hard.

309
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,600
And even for us, we have to
deal with service providers

310
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,476
on the external side.

311
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,100
We have to deal with
our own customers.

312
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,950
We have to deal with
application providers.

313
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,700
It's this very broad
ecosystem of issues

314
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,620
you have to worry about to
provide security holistically.

315
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,760
And the challenge is
pretty bumpy at times.

316
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,824
And so from that
point, I guess I'll

317
00:11:42,824 --> 00:11:44,990
have Dave talk a little bit
about a couple of things

318
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,720
we've seen.

319
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,345
You guys have any
questions before Dave

320
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:51,710
gets set up that you'd like to
ask on anything in particular?

321
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,700
Anything?

322
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,960
Come on up, Dave.

323
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,668
PROFESSOR: Oh, you've
got a question now.

324
00:11:55,668 --> 00:11:56,760
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

325
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,780
AUDIENCE: Have you
seen any APT campaigns

326
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,205
attacking MIT directly?

327
00:12:02,205 --> 00:12:03,175
PROFESSOR: Yes.

328
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:04,172
Yes.

329
00:12:04,172 --> 00:12:06,130
I think what's interesting
is one of the things

330
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:10,112
we're seeing more of is--

331
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,570
you know, one of the things
Dave will talk about now that's

332
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,610
really hard is visibility.

333
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,900
If I told you the story
about the one laptop,

334
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,217
and we have 100,000 or
150,000 devices, and also,

335
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:24,800
if you think of the number of
IP addresses MIT has just having

336
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,160
/8 network, finding the needle
in the haystack is really hard.

337
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,640
So these APTs--
which we do have--

338
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,302
finding that noise
or that activity

339
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:38,135
going on within this
broad stream of traffic

340
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:39,150
is very difficult.

341
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,150
One of the things
we've have help with

342
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,816
is some of the tools we have now
are a little bit more advanced.

343
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:45,840
And we'll talk about
that in a minute.

344
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,381
But one of the things
we also see now

345
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:50,260
is law enforcement's help
from the Federal side

346
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,077
or from other parts where
they reach out to you

347
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:54,910
to give you guidance
in some of these things

348
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:59,720
where they see things like
that, which is very helpful.

349
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,730
But you know, operating
an open environment,

350
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,150
we've had a few of
these where I've

351
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,890
been really surprised that they
were going on, but they do.

352
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,598
And I think one of
the other things we're

353
00:13:08,598 --> 00:13:11,060
going to see in the
future is-- today,

354
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,700
we do a lot of research
activity here at MIT.

355
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,530
It's one of our
primary missions.

356
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,650
The Federal funding sources
that provide for that research

357
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:24,994
don't really have a lot of
rules about how you do it.

358
00:13:24,994 --> 00:13:27,160
As you'll find out, as you
go into your grad student

359
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,576
lives and other
things and you get

360
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:30,910
Federal grants for research,
whether it's private

361
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,455
or primarily from
the government,

362
00:13:32,455 --> 00:13:36,954
whether it's the NSF, NIH, their
requirements are pretty vague.

363
00:13:36,954 --> 00:13:38,745
One of the things we're
dealing with lately

364
00:13:38,745 --> 00:13:42,880
is they'll say, we have a data
requirement in the grant that

365
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,727
says, you should have a data
policy about all the data you

366
00:13:45,727 --> 00:13:47,810
generate from your grant
is going to be preserved.

367
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:48,610
All right?

368
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:52,120
And the way MIT does that is it
says to the PI, that's great.

369
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,295
We have this requirement.

370
00:13:53,295 --> 00:13:54,670
Are you going to
take care of it?

371
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,295
They say, sure.

372
00:13:55,295 --> 00:13:56,380
I'll take care of it.

373
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,280
Sign the document, right?

374
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,460
Compliance with that?

375
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,387
What they did with it?

376
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,720
It's left to the discretion
of the primary investigator.

377
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,094
So if the government was ever
to come to us and say, hey,

378
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:08,560
where's the data?

379
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,420
Just point to a faculty member
and say, hey, talk to home.

380
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,360
But one of the things
we're also seeing

381
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,880
is the government
saying, hey, look.

382
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,070
We're investing a lot of
money in doing this research.

383
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,170
We don't want to
spend all the money

384
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,920
and give the research
to another country--

385
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,930
in some cases, right?

386
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,840
So what we've seen on
the legislative side

387
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,780
or some of the Federal
funding agencies side

388
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,845
is a lot of them are coming to
us and saying, as an industry,

389
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:31,650
I think we some more security
departments for this.

390
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,700
And I think what's
hard for us is

391
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,860
MIT is very much an incubator.

392
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,360
We have an incredible
number of brilliant people.

393
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,026
And for the
administration at large,

394
00:14:41,026 --> 00:14:42,900
we serve as sort of a
hosting company, right?

395
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,010
We incubate that activity.

396
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,705
We provide them lab spaces,
or internet connectivity,

397
00:14:46,705 --> 00:14:48,942
or all sorts of things.

398
00:14:48,942 --> 00:14:51,400
But for the most part, it's a
fairly federated environment.

399
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,290
People have a level of autonomy.

400
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,160
And so, as you have more
requirements coming up,

401
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,990
applying those across the
institution is very hard.

402
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,570
To go back to the
APT thing, there's

403
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,775
a tremendous amount of
intellectual capital here.

404
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,400
Tremendous amount of
interesting things

405
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,605
going on here that folks
outside this country

406
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,040
are very interested in.

407
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,050
And I don't know if
you guys know this.

408
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,560
What country do you think
is responsible for more

409
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,420
intellectual property theft than
most any place in the world?

410
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,888
Anyone want to take a guess?

411
00:15:18,888 --> 00:15:20,774
AUDIENCE: That's a
dangerous proposition.

412
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:21,690
PROFESSOR: No, no, no.

413
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,370
But I'm serious.

414
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,620
I mean, one of the ones that--

415
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,210
it was really shocking to me,
because I never expected it.

416
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,126
And that's not to say
they're doing that here.

417
00:15:28,126 --> 00:15:30,900
But anyone want to take a hint?

418
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,068
Come on, somebody.

419
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:35,980
Anybody.

420
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,750
AUDIENCE: China?

421
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,800
PROFESSOR: Who?

422
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,254
It's not China.

423
00:15:39,254 --> 00:15:40,150
AUDIENCE: Russia?

424
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,592
PROFESSOR: Nope.

425
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:42,175
Wasn't Russia.

426
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,105
No.

427
00:15:43,105 --> 00:15:44,304
AUDIENCE: Is it Canada?

428
00:15:44,304 --> 00:15:44,970
PROFESSOR: Nope.

429
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:45,470
[LAUGHTER]

430
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,511
You're getting close,
though, but it's in Europe.

431
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:48,680
AUDIENCE: France?

432
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,090
PROFESSOR: France.

433
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,699
France.

434
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:52,240
That's right.

435
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,070
AUDIENCE: What was it?

436
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,820
PROFESSOR: France.

437
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,246


438
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,560
Yeah.

439
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,790
So yeah, you wouldn't
expect that, right?

440
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,290
But I have a bunch
of folks who work

441
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,079
in the industry side, commercial
sector, in the security area.

442
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,995
And one of the things
they have to worry about

443
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:11,860
is companies, some of them
located in this geography,

444
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,030
is that's one of
their biggest threats,

445
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:15,220
which is kind of surprising.

446
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,110
You would think it's Iran.

447
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,226
You would think it's all
sorts of other places.

448
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,140
No.

449
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,540
And so, it's interesting, right?

450
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,950
You wouldn't expect that.

451
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,780
And that's not to say the
US isn't doing it too.

452
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,800
Let's be honest, right?

453
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,925
We're just doing it better.

454
00:16:28,925 --> 00:16:31,350
We're not getting
caught, probably.

455
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,760
But needless to say, it's one
of the more interesting things.

456
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,710
Another question?

457
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,600
You ready, Dave?

458
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,040
PROFESSOR: Sure.

459
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,000
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

460
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,540
AUDIENCE: What sorts of things
do you log on an IP sector?

461
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,444
[LAUGHTER]

462
00:16:44,444 --> 00:16:47,790
PROFESSOR: Turn
the camera off now.

463
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:51,530
We log some fairly
interesting things.

464
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,760
I'd say, for the most part,
I'll be honest with you,

465
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,440
authentication requests, we log.

466
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,071
So when you log-in
through Kerberos,

467
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,570
you log-in through
Active Directory,

468
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:01,900
you log-in through Touchstone,
through our SAML iVp,

469
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,850
those things get logged.

470
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,935
We have very detailed
retention policies, which

471
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:07,185
we're happy to share with you.

472
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:09,078
It's published.

473
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,780
If you access a web page, if
you check in to read your email,

474
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,530
things like that, then
one of the problems

475
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,320
we have is correlating
all that information

476
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,264
would be fairly hard.

477
00:17:18,265 --> 00:17:19,981
That's a lot of
different sources.

478
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,730
Dave will talk about
that in a little bit.

479
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,146
But that's pretty
much what we do.

480
00:17:23,146 --> 00:17:25,569
We try to keep our
retention period, usually,

481
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,717
within 30 days.

482
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:31,021
AUDIENCE: So MIT runs
its own CA, right?

483
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:32,920
There's a root MIT certificate.

484
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,470
Private key [INAUDIBLE] Where do
you guys keep that private key?

485
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:41,970
[LAUGHTER]

486
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:42,960
PROFESSOR: OK.

487
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,950
AUDIENCE: Could you use
tamper-resistant hardware,

488
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,908
or something like that?

489
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:46,920
Or do you just put it
on computer somewhere

490
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,900
running Linux [INAUDIBLE]?

491
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,690
PROFESSOR: Well, wow.

492
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,572
Good question.

493
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,530
Yes, we run our own CA.

494
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,860
We've been running our own
CA since the late 1990s.

495
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:01,240
So in a whole world where the
web was doing authentication

496
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,600
using username,
password over SSL,

497
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,910
I think MIT was fairly
progressive there, doing PKI.

498
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,780
Now, I don't know.

499
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,107
You guys are a little bit
younger, but back in 1998,

500
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:13,440
they were telling me the year
of PKI is just about here.

501
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,569
It's going to be next year.

502
00:18:14,569 --> 00:18:16,485
And we've been saying
that for about 20 years.

503
00:18:16,485 --> 00:18:17,879
So hopefully, soon.

504
00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:19,170
So in terms of how it's stored?

505
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,699


506
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:23,615
Tamper-resistant hardware,
that's a nice idea.

507
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,370
I like that.

508
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,090
That would be great.

509
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,731
That's not how we're doing it.

510
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:30,230
AUDIENCE: Is that
how the CAs do it?

511
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,930
PROFESSOR: So the CA's usually
do it through using USB keys

512
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,151
or other tokens that have
fairly involved protocols where

513
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,770
you can only access
information off

514
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,426
once it's been written,
in terms of you

515
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:43,050
could send something
out for signature,

516
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,410
but you can't actually
get the key off.

517
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:47,940
So they have a whole
way of doing that.

518
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,800
To be honest, the CA
server we're using now

519
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,640
was written before any
of those markets existed.

520
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,210
And so we've used, I'd
say, a typical MIT spirit

521
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,540
of being a little bit creative.

522
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:03,450
And so it is stored
on the file system.

523
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,005
It's stored in such a way to
make it difficult to recover.

524
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:07,380
And it's stored
in multiple ways.

525
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,100
And it's encrypted
with multiple keys.

526
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,610
And there's a variety of
system-specific parameters,

527
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,749
which I will not get into
every one of them here.

528
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,790
AUDIENCE: So it's more of
a security by security.

529
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

530
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,690
Yes.

531
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,570
So if you know the
specific locations,

532
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,190
which may not even be files--

533
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:26,579
I'll give you a hint to look--

534
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:28,120
and you know how
many keys are needed

535
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,705
and you know how
many bytes to read,

536
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:31,431
you might be able
to figure it out.

537
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:32,930
But to be honest
with you, if you're

538
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:35,462
able to actually get on the
machine, it's game over, right?

539
00:19:35,462 --> 00:19:37,977
If you're able to get on
the machine, it's game over.

540
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:40,018
You know, people who tell
you that they can still

541
00:19:40,018 --> 00:19:41,726
break into the machine
and not compromise

542
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:43,960
the key for some ETA, nah.

543
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,670
I'd be very
skeptical about that.

544
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:48,040
So we try to be
fairly secure, but--

545
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,684
anyway, it's not perfect.

546
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:52,350
Other questions?

547
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,230


548
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,920
AUDIENCE: Typically,
what percent

549
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,260
would you say of
MIT accounts are

550
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,059
compromised at a given time?

551
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:02,100
PROFESSOR: Good question.

552
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,420
Not yours, right?

553
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,160
I think I'm amazed--

554
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,960
so does everyone know
what phishing is?

555
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,430
AUDIENCE: Mm-hm.

556
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:08,700
PROFESSOR: OK.

557
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,105
Good.

558
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:11,688
I can't tell you how many talks
I go to where they look at you

559
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:14,690
and they say, isn't
that like Seattle?

560
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,691
But that's a little bit
of an older audience.

561
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,690
Every time one of these
phishing things happen--

562
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,981
and they happen quite a bit
where these emails go out--

563
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:23,870
I will tell you, it amazes me.

564
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,280
You're the world's smartest
institution, all right?

565
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,832
As an alum, I'm pretty
proud to believe that.

566
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:31,290
You know, we're
the world's leading

567
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:34,452
technological institution
in the world, right?

568
00:20:34,452 --> 00:20:36,660
I cannot tell you how many
people will reply to those

569
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,130
things.

570
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,440
It just always
amazes me how many

571
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,815
of them reply to
"Dear Help Desk,

572
00:20:39,815 --> 00:20:42,570
here's my user
name and password.

573
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,090
It shocks me, right?

574
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,250
And some of them are faculty.

575
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,252
And they call the
help desk and go, hey,

576
00:20:49,252 --> 00:20:50,710
I wrote back to
your quota message.

577
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,910
How come my quota
hasn't gone up?

578
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:55,330
And oh, by the way, like
my inbox is full now.

579
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,630
So what happened?

580
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,865
Well, they got 200,000 bounced
messages to be in their inbox

581
00:20:59,865 --> 00:21:02,387
because it's being used
to send mass emails.

582
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,220
So I'm being honest.

583
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,800
I'd say we see 10,
15, 20 to 30 a month.

584
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,090
During one of these phishing
spikes, even larger.

585
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,420
And I think the ones that
have been really interesting

586
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,550
are the ones we
don't know about, OK?

587
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,020
And the government came to us, I
don't know, about a year or two

588
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,500
ago and said, hey, we
won't get into specifics,

589
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,730
but there's a
marketplace where you

590
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,650
can buy MIT usernames
and passwords so you

591
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,640
can access library resources.

592
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:33,497
And so they're bidding on them
online on these black markets.

593
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:35,372
If you'd like to access
all the materials MIT

594
00:21:35,372 --> 00:21:37,667
has in their libraries
or on campus,

595
00:21:37,667 --> 00:21:39,500
you can simply auction
one of these accounts

596
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,860
that they've compromised
off the web page.

597
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,486
And they said, oh, by the
way, do you know about this?

598
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:45,841
No.

599
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:46,340
No.

600
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:49,890
And so we see a tremendous
number of those.

601
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,820
The success of
the social vectors

602
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,160
for getting people's
credentials is

603
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,414
incredibly high, in particular,
across our industry--

604
00:21:56,414 --> 00:21:58,580
Dave will talk about it in
a little bit, how you try

605
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,170
and mitigate those
things-- is very high.

606
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,970
And it's a little bit scary.

607
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,310
Yeah?

608
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,140
AUDIENCE: Dealing on that, is
there a way or some web site

609
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,650
to see all the places
you've logged-in

610
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,470
with Touchstone or something?

611
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,410
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

612
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:18,990
So we're working on-- one of the
things I talked about in answer

613
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:22,070
to the log question was
what do you guys collect?

614
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:23,570
We collect a variety
of information.

615
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:25,880
One of the things we don't
have the ability to do today

616
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,640
is to correlate.

617
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,317
So in our case, there's 30
different technology systems

618
00:22:30,317 --> 00:22:32,650
involved in some of these
things, and different formats,

619
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,509
and all sorts of different
ways to generate it.

620
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:37,300
We are working to try
and make that easier.

621
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,960
And our hope is to give the
user community something where,

622
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,470
from a GeoIP or
other standpoint,

623
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,220
they can see where
their activity is maybe

624
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,357
over the last 30
days, or seven days,

625
00:22:45,357 --> 00:22:47,045
or whatever their
retention period is,

626
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:48,420
to help inform
people about where

627
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,544
these things are happening.

628
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:51,311
Dave wants to go a step further.

629
00:22:51,311 --> 00:22:53,310
He wants to have you can
pick a circle of radius

630
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:55,730
where you're allowed to
log-in from geographically.

631
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,569
And if you log-in from
outside that range,

632
00:22:57,569 --> 00:22:59,360
it either shouldn't
allow it, or it'll just

633
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,752
send a text to your phone to
let you know that something

634
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:03,870
happened, which I think is a
step in the right direction.

635
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:06,330
But so yes, we're
working on that,

636
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:09,266
but we don't have it today.

637
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:11,736
AUDIENCE: You said there was
malicious traffic on the MIT

638
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:12,724
network?

639
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,210
PROFESSOR: Yes.

640
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,086
In terms of--

641
00:23:15,086 --> 00:23:16,586
AUDIENCE: What's
the primary source?

642
00:23:16,586 --> 00:23:18,195
Is it from outside going in?

643
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:22,384
Or is there malicious traffic
from the inside going out?

644
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,550
PROFESSOR: You know, I'd
love to say it's completely

645
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,040
from the outside coming in.

646
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,466
I'd say there's a fair bit of
it from the inside going out.

647
00:23:29,466 --> 00:23:32,090
I think, realistically, we have
a tremendous amount of internet

648
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,170
bandwidth and connectivity.

649
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,650
We'll talk about some of these
more recent UDP reflection

650
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,730
attacks, which is
a great example.

651
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,184
But when you have
big pipes, it's

652
00:23:40,184 --> 00:23:42,047
a good resource to use
to hurt other folks.

653
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,880
And so we see a lot of
that, I'd say more so

654
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:44,755
than stuff coming in.

655
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:46,255
Stuff coming in,
you see a fair bit,

656
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:47,920
like I talked about
with the laptop.

657
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,625
But I'd say, in terms of
actual volume of traffic,

658
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,250
the bigger stuff you
see is in and out,

659
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,466
in terms of just
sheer throughput.

660
00:23:56,466 --> 00:23:59,220
AUDIENCE: How many
people connect to the MIT

661
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,640
Network on a given day?

662
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,320
PROFESSOR: On a given day,
I'd say like, I don't know,

663
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,190
100,000, 120,000 different
kinds of devices.

664
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,320
I'd say, people-wise, if you
figure people average 2-1/2

665
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,174
devices, probably 35,000 folks,
40,000 folks on a given day.

666
00:24:14,174 --> 00:24:16,590
I think what's more surprising
is our visitor population's

667
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,589
fairly large in a month.

668
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,050


669
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,133
AUDIENCE: What's the policy
for running a TOR exit

670
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:23,461
node on the MIT network?

671
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,210
PROFESSOR: Policy?

672
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:24,672
What?

673
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:25,171
No.

674
00:24:25,171 --> 00:24:26,520
[LAUGHTER]

675
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,830
AUDIENCE: Is there a
good reason not to?

676
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,492
PROFESSOR: So you know, MIT's
a very open place, all right?

677
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:33,700
And I think that's one of
the great beauties of being

678
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
a student here and one
of the things I've always

679
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,120
cherished about being here
is we're a place where

680
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,565
it's OK to experiment.

681
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:40,440
It's OK to do things.

682
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,590
It's OK to learn about things.

683
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,510
It's OK to develop new things.

684
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,650
That's one of the great
things about being at MIT

685
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,430
and it's what's special
about being here too, right?

686
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,629
That's what's pretty unique.

687
00:24:48,629 --> 00:24:50,670
You don't need to go to
the policy office to say,

688
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:53,625
hey, I want to run a
core exit node today,

689
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,500
or I want to invent a
new anonymous protocol,

690
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,560
or something like that.

691
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,060
That's one of the thing's that's
really unique about working

692
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,480
here and going to school here.

693
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,800
And I think, for us, is it a
good idea or is it a bad idea,

694
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,760
depends how you're
trying to do it, right?

695
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,087
If you're doing it as part
of some thesis research

696
00:25:09,087 --> 00:25:11,045
into an automatization
technique, some privacy,

697
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,604
it's probably fine.

698
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:14,020
If you're doing
it for the purpose

699
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,461
of running some kind of black
market ring or something

700
00:25:17,461 --> 00:25:17,960
like that--

701
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,210
I mean it's probably
not a good idea.

702
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,010
But from a policy standpoint,
MIT's fairly flexible.

703
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,635
We really try to
balance the need for--

704
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:29,135
the institution has
a responsibility

705
00:25:29,135 --> 00:25:30,662
to behave responsibly, right?

706
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:31,554
Let's just be honest.

707
00:25:31,554 --> 00:25:33,350
As an institution,
we have to do that.

708
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:35,480
But we try as much as
possible not to encumber

709
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,320
the activity of innovation.

710
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,090
And so, for the most part,
that's worked out pretty well.

711
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:42,780
I'd say MIT's been fairly
successful over the last 125

712
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,720
years.

713
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,020
But you know, I think it's
one of those areas where

714
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,850
if one of those
activities was to place

715
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:51,595
the institution collectively
in jeopardy, then

716
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:53,180
we have to look at that.

717
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,140
But MIT does run a
variety of TOR exit nodes.

718
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,650
SIPI has some.

719
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,930
CSAIL has a few.

720
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,770
They show up on Dave's
naughty list like a plague,

721
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,740
but we do that.

722
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,210
You can't run that
at most schools.

723
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:06,710
Questions?

724
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:13,660


725
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,880
My esteemed colleague,
Dave LaPorte.

726
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,867
He from used to work in the
Harvard University network.

727
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:22,700
And he'll talk a little
bit about networking

728
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,682
at a liberal arts school, if you
get him outside of the office.

729
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:29,578
And he's also a teacher
himself at Northeastern,

730
00:26:29,578 --> 00:26:31,526
which is great.

731
00:26:31,526 --> 00:26:33,660
So Dave will talk
to you a little bit

732
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,839
about some specific examples
of the kings of things

733
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,880
that keep us up at night.

734
00:26:36,880 --> 00:27:01,207


735
00:27:01,207 --> 00:27:02,040
PROFESSOR: Oh, wait.

736
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:02,290
Wait.

737
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:03,140
I think I got it.

738
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,848
Loose connection.

739
00:27:03,848 --> 00:27:10,835


740
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:11,335
OK.

741
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:17,192


742
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:17,692
[INAUDIBLE]

743
00:27:17,692 --> 00:27:22,350


744
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:22,850
All right.

745
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,690
Hello, everybody.

746
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,690
My name is Dave LaPorte.

747
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,050


748
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,950
As this very verbose
title claims,

749
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,272
I am Manager of Infrastructure
and Security Operations,

750
00:27:33,272 --> 00:27:34,730
which basically in
a nutshell means

751
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:38,970
I'm responsible for maintaining
and operating and securing

752
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:44,190
mit.net, which is
definitely a full-time job.

753
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,212
Today, I've got a lot
of content to cover.

754
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:49,670
I'm going to cruise through
it, to leave room for questions

755
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,878
at the end, because I think
that's probably where you

756
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,070
guys get the most out of it.

757
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,990
If anything's not
clear, just stop me.

758
00:27:54,990 --> 00:27:55,220
Raise your hand.

759
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,511
I don't mind being interrupted.

760
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:58,930


761
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:02,170
But yeah, with that, we'll
start talking with the Security

762
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:05,800
Operations Team, which is
really the one central body that

763
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,432
does security as a
full-time job here at MIT.

764
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:09,890
We'll talk about
some of the events

765
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,530
that we've had in
the recent past here

766
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:14,610
and what we've done
to mitigate them

767
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:18,970
and to leave the current
state of security at mit.net.

768
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,910
We'll talk about the
current landscape, what

769
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,210
we're facing a lot of now,
which-- as Mark alluded to--

770
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,600
is to a large degree, social.

771
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,150
And we'll talk about
some future trends,

772
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:35,340
which are nebulous by nature, so
the slides are kind of sparse.

773
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,520
So the team there, as
you can see is Mark.

774
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,090
I report directly to Mark.

775
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:42,530
Under me, there's a
Security Operations Team

776
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,440
led by our team
lead, Harry Hoffman.

777
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,325
He has three people under
him, Andrew Munchbach,

778
00:28:49,325 --> 00:28:51,080
who basically is
the analyst who does

779
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,880
a lot of the washing
of the systems,

780
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,190
does a lot of the
notifications to users,

781
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,461
responds to complaints
from the outside world.

782
00:28:57,461 --> 00:29:00,086
Then Mike Hossle, who does a lot
of the engineering activities,

783
00:29:00,086 --> 00:29:01,910
a lot of the forensics.

784
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,600
And you have Monique
Buchanan, who

785
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,840
handles a lot of the
correspondence and community

786
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,370
outreach.

787
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,765
Harry himself is also
extremely hands-on.

788
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,515
So I just want to
preface this whole thing

789
00:29:11,515 --> 00:29:14,045
with we have a team of four
in a very large institution

790
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,650
with tons of devices.

791
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,530
So the federation
that Mark talked about

792
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,900
is really a necessity,
in order to even try

793
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,579
to secure a network
of this size.

794
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:24,620
So now, the portfolio
services we have and what--

795
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,730
we're going to blast
through this stuff fast--

796
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:30,750
consulting, we talk with
people and help them on campus.

797
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,280
Services, we provide some
services to the community.

798
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,620
And the tool set that we use.

799
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:41,520
The services we provide
are pretty varied.

800
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,230
We do abuse reporting.

801
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,790
So this is response
to complaints

802
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,391
from the outside
world, typically,

803
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:50,000
the vast majority of which
are Tor exit node-related.

804
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:50,700
[LAUGHTER]

805
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,076
They just are.

806
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:53,584
PROFESSOR: They just are.

807
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:55,250
PROFESSOR: Endpoint
protection, so there

808
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,250
are some tools and
products out there

809
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,800
that we install on both the
community at large machines--

810
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,680
you opt-in if you prefer.

811
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,115
If you're part of the MIT
domain, which is typically

812
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:08,602
administrative staff, some
might be auto-installed for you.

813
00:30:08,602 --> 00:30:10,810
Network protection, these
are tool sets that we have,

814
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,260
either at the border
or throughout mit.net

815
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:19,570
that detect anomalies or
capture flow data for analysis.

816
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,071
Data analytics helps us
correlate, put all this stuff

817
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,404
together and try to get some
actionable intelligence out

818
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:26,100
of it.

819
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:30,300
Forensics are-- well, we'll
talk about those in a second.

820
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,830
Risk identification, basically
probing and assessment tools,

821
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:37,750
basically Nessus and
things that look for PII,

822
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,010
Personally Identifiable
Information.

823
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:44,210
which, being in Massachusetts,
we need to comply with 201 CMR

824
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,470
17.00, which is a Mass
regulation that requires us

825
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:51,650
to be able to identify where all
the PII on our network lives.

826
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,520
Outreach awareness and
training, just what it says.

827
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,590
Compliance needs, this is,
in large part, PCI DSS.

828
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,160
So PCI, being the
Payment Card Industry,

829
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,302
has DSS, which is the
Data Security Standard.

830
00:31:04,302 --> 00:31:06,760
Believe it or not, MIT-- well,
you'll probably believe it--

831
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,570
MIT is a credit card merchant.

832
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,140
We have multiple
vendors on campus,

833
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,750
and we need to be
able to make sure

834
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:15,620
that that infrastructure
is compliant with PCI DSS.

835
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,700
So Security is a part of the
team that basically manages

836
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,820
and ensures that compliance.

837
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,230
PCI 3.0, which is the sixth
major update to the standard,

838
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:28,820
goes live on January 1.

839
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,800
So we're kind of in
the process right now

840
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:33,460
of ensuring compliance of
all of our infrastructure.

841
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:39,520
And providing reporting alerting
metrics on the work we do.

842
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,440
So here's some of the end point
protection products we use.

843
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,100
This eagle-- I think
it's an eagle there--

844
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,890
is a tool called CrowdStrike,
which is currently

845
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,595
being tested within
IS&T. Basically, it's

846
00:31:53,595 --> 00:31:56,990
a tool that watches
for anomalous behavior

847
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,350
from a system call perspective.

848
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,977
If you're using Word,
and Word suddenly

849
00:32:00,977 --> 00:32:02,810
starts doing something
that it shouldn't do,

850
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:05,320
like maybe trying to read
the account database off

851
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,430
of the system and a
bunch of passwords,

852
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,220
it alerts and throws a flag.

853
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,430
It's a cloud-based tool, which
we'll talk more about later.

854
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,120
So all this data gets
sent to a central console.

855
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,890
And should machines start
doing things untoward

856
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,430
from a heuristic or
behavioral perspective,

857
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:24,040
they get red flagged.

858
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,410
GPO here, these are just
Group Policy Objects,

859
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,950
so managed systems
which push down policy.

860
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,790
The S is Sophos.

861
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,320
It's anti-xrays,
anti-malware, anti-spam--

862
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,130
oh, not anti-spam--
but anti-malware,

863
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,210
anti-virus, all of
the typical stuff

864
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:41,750
that we expect when we buy and
end point protection product.

865
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:48,480
PGP does hard drive encryption
for select systems on campus

866
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,650
that have sensitive data.

867
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,070
Some of these tools are in flux.

868
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,180
The industry seems to be
going more towards a more

869
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,540
vendor-neutral
solution, if you want

870
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:02,420
to call it that, so BitLocker on
Windows, FileVault on the Mac.

871
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,720
So we're exploring
those options as well.

872
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,070
And Casper is a way to manage,
mostly Macs, to enforce policy

873
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,980
on managed Macs.

874
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,760
On the network protection side--

875
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,770
I'll just start down here.

876
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,280
Akamai is a company
that came out of MIT,

877
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,780
has a lot of MIT alums.

878
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,220
They also have
extremely good services,

879
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:28,410
so we have partnered with them
on a lot of their services.

880
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:31,390
And we'll talk about
them fairly extensively.

881
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:35,900
TippingPoint is an IDS vendor,
an intrusion detection system.

882
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,197
As I said, some of
these tools are in flux.

883
00:33:38,197 --> 00:33:39,280
That might be one of them.

884
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:42,740
But we basically have an
intrusion prevention system

885
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,750
at our border.

886
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,970
We don't actually
prevent, we just detect.

887
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:49,600
So we don't actually block
anything on the MIT border,

888
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,370
except for some very
basic anti-spoofing

889
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,300
and standard rules
you'd find anywhere.

890
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,610
Stealth Watch is a tool that
generates NetFlow data--

891
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,870
or I should say
collects NetFlow data.

892
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,140
So we use Cisco devices,
but all network devices

893
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,924
will output details,
meta information

894
00:34:07,924 --> 00:34:09,679
about the flows that
they're sending,

895
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,415
source port, dest port,
source IP, dest IP, protocol,

896
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:14,380
et cetera.

897
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:18,520
StealthWatch collects this, does
some basic security analysis

898
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,650
on it, and also
provides APIs that we

899
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,310
can interface our
tools with to do

900
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,949
some more intelligent things.

901
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:28,580
And RSA Security Analytics,
this is another tool.

902
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,570
[BANG] Oops.

903
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,710
It's, in a lot of ways,
like an IDS on steroids.

904
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,800
It does full packet
capture, so you can actually

905
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,864
see some content if
things get red flagged.

906
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:42,310


907
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,090
On the risk
identification front,

908
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:50,290
Nessus, kind of the de facto
vulnerability assessment tool.

909
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:52,350
So we typically
use this on-demand.

910
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:55,420
We don't unleash this
on 18/8 at large.

911
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:59,240
But if we get an
on campus DLC that

912
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,360
would like us to come in and
perform some basic assessment

913
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,750
for them, we can use Nessus.

914
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,810
Shodan is a computer-- they call
it a computer search engine.

915
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,430
Basically, they scan
the internet at large

916
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,334
and have lots of, lots
of good security data.

917
00:35:13,334 --> 00:35:14,750
We have a subscription,
so that we

918
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,940
can leverage that intelligence.

919
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,790
And Identity Finder,
that's a tool

920
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,930
that we use in locations
where there's PII,

921
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,480
Personally Identifiable
Information,

922
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,652
in order to comply
with mass regs

923
00:35:26,652 --> 00:35:28,985
and just to make sure we know
where critical data lives.

924
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:31,920


925
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:42,163
Forensics is a
business that is--

926
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:43,430
periodic?

927
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,950
I'm looking for the right word.

928
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,250
This isn't something we
do, until we do a lot of it

929
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,010
for a long time.

930
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:49,410
And then we don't
do a lot of it.

931
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,430
Basically, when cases surface,
we have the tool sets.

932
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,510
EnCase is a tool that
allows us to image drives

933
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,450
and go through them
looking for content.

934
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:59,575
FTK, the Forensic Toolkit and
the Sleuth Kit are other tools.

935
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:02,090


936
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:06,160
We often get called in for cases
where we have to image drives

937
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,300
for intellectual property cases
or whatever cases the OGC,

938
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,900
the Office of the
General Counsel,

939
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:15,910
needs to have
computers imaged for.

940
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,520
So we have all the tools
that's necessary to do that.

941
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,050
But frankly, it's
not our day job.

942
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,154
It's something that
comes up occasionally.

943
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:23,820
So how do we put all
this data together?

944
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,690
Mark alluded to correlation.

945
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,165
We have operating system
logs for managed systems.

946
00:36:30,165 --> 00:36:31,540
You can see that
we have NetFlow.

947
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,940
We have some DHCP logs,
IDS logs, Touchstone logs.

948
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:41,440
Splunk is a tool that does
a lot of this correlation

949
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,842
work and take data that's
not necessarily normalized

950
00:36:44,842 --> 00:36:46,740
and normalize it and
allow us to correlate

951
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,690
across different sources
to get more intelligence.

952
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,117
So when you were talking about--

953
00:36:52,117 --> 00:36:53,700
whomever out there
asked about, maybe,

954
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,720
a log-in page that could
show where you last logged

955
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,280
in, et cetera,
Splunk would probably

956
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,915
be the enabling
technology for that,

957
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:03,540
because we can put
everything together,

958
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,340
we can do GeoIP lookups,
and really build something

959
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,080
on top of the raw data,
pull some actual wisdom

960
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,605
of that data, so that we could
present it to you in a page.

961
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:16,540


962
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,040
OK.

963
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,055
So now, we'll talk
about attacks and things

964
00:37:21,055 --> 00:37:23,274
that you might find
more interesting.

965
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:25,440
We'll talk first about
Distributed Denial of Service

966
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,940
attacks, which we've
really received

967
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,290
a lot of in the past few years.

968
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,040
We'll also talk
specifically about attacks

969
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,160
that resulted from the Aaron
Swartz tragedy of a few years

970
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,730
ago, which ties in to the
Distributed Denial of Service

971
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,850
attacks.

972
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:41,350
OK.

973
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:44,230
So just a primer on
Distributed Denial of Service.

974
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,110
I apologize if this is remedial.

975
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,980
So Denial of Service
attack really

976
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,110
attacks the A of the CIA triad.

977
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,110
CIA triad's the foundation
of computer security.

978
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,955
It's Confidentiality,
Integrity, and Availability.

979
00:37:55,955 --> 00:37:57,830
So we're going after
the availability, right?

980
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,260
We want to take a resource down
so that legitimate users can't

981
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,092
use it.

982
00:38:03,092 --> 00:38:04,550
That could be
defacement of a page.

983
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,530
Very simple, right?

984
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,362
Digital graffiti, just ruin the
page so nobody could see it.

985
00:38:08,362 --> 00:38:09,820
Could be resource
consumption where

986
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,510
you eat up all the
computation on a system,

987
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,700
all the bandwidth on a network.

988
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,219
Could be a single attacker.

989
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:17,760
But much more likely
nowadays, you're

990
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,384
going to invite your
friends and you're

991
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:20,957
going to have a
party and a DDoS,

992
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:22,290
a Distributed Denial of Service.

993
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:27,330


994
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,340
OK these are recent
trends in the industry.

995
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,580
These are pulled from
the Arbor Networks

996
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,010
State of the Internet report.

997
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,370
Hacktivism is the most
common motivation.

998
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:43,690
According to them, it's
40% of all claimed--

999
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,240
actually, those attacks that
are attributed, 40% of them

1000
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,090
are attributed to hacktivism.

1001
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:50,030
The next one is 39% unknown.

1002
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:56,380
So it's dominating
the top of the heap.

1003
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,750
Last year-- and these numbers,
I believe, are from 2013--

1004
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,320
there were multiple
100Gbps attacks.

1005
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,850
So the year before
that made news

1006
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:07,885
because I think there was
an attack on Spamhaus that

1007
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:09,990
was 300Gbpm.

1008
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,244
This following year,
that's kind of--

1009
00:39:12,244 --> 00:39:13,660
I wouldn't say the
norm, but we're

1010
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,280
seeing a lot more of that.

1011
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,570
Longer-lasting attack,
this operation here,

1012
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,850
Ababil, was a multi-month
attack against the US

1013
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:25,370
financial sector.

1014
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,720
It went on for months.

1015
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,579
It was 65Gps sustained at times.

1016
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,870
I've heard stories about
this-- but you can Google more

1017
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,700
online--

1018
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,130
where it was just relentless.

1019
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,600
They just couldn't stop it.

1020
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,170
And we'll talk about the way
that they ended up doing it.

1021
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:42,919
But frankly, at
65Gbps or at 100Gbps,

1022
00:39:42,919 --> 00:39:44,710
you're at the mercy of
the attacker, right?

1023
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,200
There's very few
organizations on the planet

1024
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,390
that can sustain an attack--

1025
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:54,260
can sustain-- can survive
a sustained attack

1026
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,622
of that magnitude.

1027
00:39:55,622 --> 00:39:58,350
You just can't do it.

1028
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,400
And we're seeing a shift towards
reflection and amplification

1029
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,310
attacks.

1030
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:07,080
So this is where you
take a small input

1031
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,720
and generate a large output.

1032
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,640
This is nothing new.

1033
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,610
This goes way back to--

1034
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,070
let's go ahead a sec, all
right, I left that slide out--

1035
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:22,880
but this goes way back
to the ICMP Smurf attack

1036
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,645
where you would ping a
broadcast address of a network,

1037
00:40:25,645 --> 00:40:27,020
and every machine
on that network

1038
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,326
would respond to the
supposed originator

1039
00:40:30,326 --> 00:40:32,700
of the packet, which, of
course, would be spoofed, right?

1040
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,090
So I would masquerade as Mark.

1041
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,580
I would sent a packet to this
class's broadcast address.

1042
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,960
And you would all respond
with packets to Mark,

1043
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
thinking that he sent it.

1044
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,410
Meanwhile, I sit in
the corner and laugh.

1045
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,770
So this is nothing new.

1046
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,050
This goes back-- I mean,
when I was in high school,

1047
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:51,011
I was reading about this stuff.

1048
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:53,170
[LAUGHTER]

1049
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:57,370
So UDP and ICMP, but UDP is
a fire and forget protocol,

1050
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:57,870
right?

1051
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,746
It's not TCP.

1052
00:40:58,746 --> 00:40:59,495
It's not reliable.

1053
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:01,220
It's not connection-oriented.

1054
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,740
So fire and forget,
it's easily spoofable.

1055
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,780
And over the past
year, what we've seen

1056
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:12,560
are exploits of amplifiable
features of these three

1057
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,720
protocols, in particular.

1058
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,844
So DNS-- this isn't working.

1059
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:20,150
It works with a clicker.

1060
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,280
DNS, port 53, UDP, right?

1061
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,770
Basically, if you sent
a 64-byte ANY query

1062
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:30,000
to a misconfigured
server, it would respond

1063
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,740
with a 512-byte response.

1064
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,070
So that's an 8X
amplification factor there.

1065
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,400
Not bad.

1066
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,860
What we found personally
here on mit.net was,

1067
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,022
when this whole trend
started, like most things--

1068
00:41:44,022 --> 00:41:46,230
EDUs and particularly here--
we were at the forefront

1069
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,210
into this trend.

1070
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:49,640
We were seeing this
before it really took off

1071
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,190
against commercial victims.

1072
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,890
But we saw a 12-gig DNS
amplification attack here,

1073
00:41:56,890 --> 00:42:00,500
which substantially impacted
our outbound bandwidth.

1074
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,190
We have sufficient bandwidth.

1075
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,550
But at those rates, if you add
that to legitimate traffic,

1076
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,810
we started to notice issues.

1077
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:10,150
And Mark and I had to
come in and resolve that.

1078
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,270


1079
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:18,710
SNMP, which is UDP port
161, very useful management

1080
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,750
protocol.

1081
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:24,820
But if you send a GetBulkRequest
of 64 bytes to a device

1082
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,330
that's improperly configured, it
will respond with up to 1,000X

1083
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,560
amplification.

1084
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:33,100
So that's even better, right?

1085
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,308
If you're an attacker, you're
going to target things.

1086
00:42:35,308 --> 00:42:38,950
And we saw huge attacks
against printers on campus.

1087
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,290
So they would have a printer
with an open SNMP agent.

1088
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:44,280
They would send packets to it.

1089
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,360
And we would send back 1,000 of
them and pollute the internet.

1090
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,720
NTP, Network Time Protocol.

1091
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,220
In this case, a
misconfigured server

1092
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,514
would respond to MONLIST
command, which would--

1093
00:42:59,514 --> 00:43:01,180
I'm not sure of the
amplification factor

1094
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:01,680
on that one.

1095
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
But that one's really,
really popular.

1096
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,970
So we got hit pretty
hard with the NTP MONLIST

1097
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:08,530
misconfiguration.

1098
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,150
And we ended up
doing a few things

1099
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:12,450
to mitigate all these attacks.

1100
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:14,590
So on the NTP side,
we disabled MONLIST

1101
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:16,950
on the NTP server we
could, which kind of

1102
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,080
kills the attack in its tracks.

1103
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:21,960
But this being a federated
institution where we don't have

1104
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,924
power over nearly anything--

1105
00:43:23,924 --> 00:43:24,840
I shouldn't say that--

1106
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,420
nearly everything,
there's just a lot

1107
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,370
of things we just don't have the
reach to touch or the authority

1108
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:30,024
to touch.

1109
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,440
So what we ended
up doing was just

1110
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,530
rate-limiting NTP at the border.

1111
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:36,940
And that's been in place
now for almost a year?

1112
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,180
Almost a year with almost
no negative impact.

1113
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,140
So we rate-limited down to,
let's say, a few megabits,

1114
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,640
which was certainly better than
the gigs we were sending out

1115
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,890
to the internet previously.

1116
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:49,990
So that's kind of
a solved problem.

1117
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:56,380
DNS is a bit harder, was a
bit harder to take care of.

1118
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,390
What we ended up doing
was started to leverage

1119
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,860
an Akamai service called, eDNS.

1120
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,720
So Akamai has this
service where you could

1121
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,900
host your zones with them.

1122
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:06,150
They're one of many providers.

1123
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,852
But we had an
existing relationship

1124
00:44:07,852 --> 00:44:09,810
with Akamai, which I'll
talk about in a minute.

1125
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:14,240
So we leveraged their eDNA,
bifurcated our DNS, our domain

1126
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,270
name system space.

1127
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:18,720
We put an external
view on Akamai.

1128
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,070
We put an internal on the
servers that always served MIT.

1129
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:25,410
And then we ACL'd off
the internal view,

1130
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,220
so only MIT clients could
hit our internal servers.

1131
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:31,290
And the rest of the
world hits Akamai.

1132
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:34,380
The benefit of Akamai eDNS
is it's hosted in a content

1133
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,690
distribution network.

1134
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,960
It's all over the world.

1135
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,170
It's being served out of
Asia, Europe, North America

1136
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:42,510
East, West.

1137
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:45,472
It's all over the place.

1138
00:44:45,472 --> 00:44:46,930
Most people can't
take down Akamai,

1139
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,532
so we don't have to worry about
our DNS going down any more.

1140
00:44:49,532 --> 00:44:51,490
So that's kind of how we
resolved that problem.

1141
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,950


1142
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:55,450
OK.

1143
00:44:55,450 --> 00:45:00,350
So these are details of
the attacks themselves.

1144
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:03,080
Source obfuscation, this
is probably remedial.

1145
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,163
Why you do it, to avoid
detection and prosecution.

1146
00:45:05,163 --> 00:45:07,770


1147
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,070
I'll skip that one.

1148
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:10,570
OK.

1149
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:12,480
So maybe you don't want
to hide your address

1150
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,460
or spoof your
address, you just want

1151
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,420
to destroy a target with bots.

1152
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:20,632
So botnets are huge right now.

1153
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:23,820
The "it's OK, no
problem, bro" was

1154
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,510
used in that operation Ababil,
which really targeted the US

1155
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,390
financial sector.

1156
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,140
So in this case, rather
than just spoofing

1157
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:33,330
a bunch of packets
from one host,

1158
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:37,170
we're using a botnet
of legitimate systems

1159
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,340
that don't necessarily
need to just spoof.

1160
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,810
Since these are
legitimate systems

1161
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:45,040
and they'll respond
to, say, a TCP synack,

1162
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,920
we can actually do more
higher level attacks,

1163
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,967
like attack an HTTP server
and do GET and POST floods.

1164
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:53,630


1165
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,180
They might hire stressors.

1166
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:57,880
Stressors are basically
botnets for hire

1167
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,170
where you hire them
to do load testing,

1168
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:06,440
and they go and load test
someone else for you.

1169
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,980
There's, no doubt, probably
legitimate ones out there.

1170
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:13,334
But there are others that
aren't and are basically

1171
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:14,500
denial of services for hire.

1172
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,140


1173
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,770
OK, so the mitigation
strategies.

1174
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:22,800
We talked about
one, which is DNS.

1175
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,500
We can use DNS to
mitigate these attacks.

1176
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,620
So we have used
Akamai to do that.

1177
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:32,150
In this graphic here-- which
is probably too small for you

1178
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:33,810
to see--

1179
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:41,170
but basically, this slide
is way too far ahead

1180
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,030
where it should be.

1181
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:44,770
So OK, we had an attack
against our web server,

1182
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:46,300
so I'll just brief
you real quick.

1183
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,730
One of the attacks that
followed the Swartz tragedy

1184
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,050
was an attack against web.mit.

1185
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,840
They took down our web server.

1186
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,880
The way we solved that was
we used our bifurcated DNS

1187
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,520
to point internal clients
to web.mit internally.

1188
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,240
And then we use the Akamai
content distribution network

1189
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,710
to basically mirror web.mit.

1190
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,450
And then we used
the external view

1191
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:11,020
of our DNS to point
external clients to Akamai.

1192
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:14,560
So when a user out
on the internet--

1193
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,200
which we'll say is over here--

1194
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,620
wants to go to
web.mit, they actually

1195
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:22,180
go to the Akamai CDN, which
serves up the content.

1196
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,790
If it's content that,
for some reason,

1197
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:25,580
they can't directly
serve out cache,

1198
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:31,050
it's dynamic or whatever, the
origin server, which is still

1199
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:35,910
web.mit, and Akamai will go and
fetch the necessary content,

1200
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:38,370
send it to the user, and
then potentially cache it

1201
00:47:38,370 --> 00:47:40,050
for some interval.

1202
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,350
So short story here
is that the attack--

1203
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:44,840
I'll talk about it in a minute--

1204
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:47,520
but the way we solved it was
we put the actual web server

1205
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,462
on the content distribution
network of Akamai.

1206
00:47:50,462 --> 00:47:53,870


1207
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,380
The other attacks
that we'll talk

1208
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,950
about-- this how we mitigated.

1209
00:47:57,950 --> 00:48:01,982
These two slides
are out of order.

1210
00:48:01,982 --> 00:48:03,190
So I mentioned a few attacks.

1211
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:06,090
I mentioned the NTP attack.

1212
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,050
I'm going to mention
a couple of others.

1213
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,610
But basically, these
are attacks that

1214
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,130
are just brute force, trying
to overwhelm our bandwidth.

1215
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,140
And I mentioned, when
you get up into the tens

1216
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:19,830
of gigabits range, a lot
of internet end users,

1217
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,849
such as MIT--

1218
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:23,140
you can name another service
provider, but a very large

1219
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,170
user-- even we would
have trouble handling

1220
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:28,077
tens of gigabits of traffic.

1221
00:48:28,077 --> 00:48:30,410
So in that case, your options
are really limited, right?

1222
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:31,868
If it's spoofed
traffic, how do you

1223
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:35,260
put a filter at your border
to block this traffic?

1224
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:37,702
And even so, once it's
got to your border

1225
00:48:37,702 --> 00:48:39,910
where you filter it, it's
already flooded your pipes.

1226
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:41,047
So how do you do this?

1227
00:48:41,047 --> 00:48:43,630
You have to push it back up into
the cloud, into the internet,

1228
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,200
and block it there.

1229
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,305
And the way that many
people are choosing to do it

1230
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:51,719
and the way we've done it here
is through BGP mitigation.

1231
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:54,010
So if you're familiar with
BGP, which is Border Gateway

1232
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,250
Protocol, it's the protocol that
runs routing on the internet.

1233
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:59,680
And it's a path
vector protocol that

1234
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,630
uses ASN, so autonomous
system numbers.

1235
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,840
So every multi-homed
organization on the internet

1236
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,180
has an ASN, an
autonomous system number.

1237
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:16,410
And BGP uses that
number to build paths

1238
00:49:16,410 --> 00:49:19,120
through the internet so that you
can have multiple paths to get

1239
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,090
to a particular ASN.

1240
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:24,225
In this case, I'm
using example 123,

1241
00:49:24,225 --> 00:49:27,230
because I created this
for another organization.

1242
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:31,530
We're three, because
we're awesome like that.

1243
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:35,020
Harvard was 11, so they're a
little slower to the punch.

1244
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,930
But in this case,
we've got a path.

1245
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:41,990
So we've got the beginning
of the path is ASN123.

1246
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,160
The end of the path is 789.

1247
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,990
And there's some sequence
of ASes, autonomous systems,

1248
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:50,320
that this packet
has to pass through.

1249
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,160
So what we're going
to with BGP mitigation

1250
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,050
is just inject another
ASN into the mix.

1251
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,100
And that ASN has
the capabilities

1252
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,000
to handle this traffic on our.

1253
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,020
So in this case, we have ASN456.

1254
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,210
And they are going to be
kind of a sanctioned man

1255
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,460
in the middle for us.

1256
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,290
We're going to allow them to
advertise our prefixes so that,

1257
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:20,480
when we come under
attack, if 18.1.2.3.0/24,

1258
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,070
a small slice of 255 addresses
at MIT comes under attack,

1259
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:31,980
we allow this AS456 to advertise
that prefix on our behalf.

1260
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:34,620
Once that change propagates
across the internet,

1261
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,480
all of the traffic starts
going into that AS.

1262
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,119
And in this case, for
us, that AS is Akamai.

1263
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:42,410
And they have lots of scrubbers
and can handle the high

1264
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,240
bandwidth that we can't.

1265
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:46,970
So on the back end
of that connection

1266
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,940
is a private connection
we have into Akamai

1267
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,640
where they send
the post-scrubbed,

1268
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,110
the clean traffic out to us.

1269
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:56,310
And that way, we can
avoid these sorts

1270
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:58,195
of potentially
deadly attacks that

1271
00:50:58,195 --> 00:50:59,550
could just take us offline.

1272
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:01,460
If you're getting hit
with that much traffic,

1273
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,793
there's just nothing you can do.

1274
00:51:02,793 --> 00:51:07,664


1275
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:09,080
So actually, before
we keep going,

1276
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:13,400
any questions on what
we've covered so far?

1277
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,692
Yes?

1278
00:51:14,692 --> 00:51:16,900
AUDIENCE: This is just more
of a networking question.

1279
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,983
You mentioned the borders.

1280
00:51:17,983 --> 00:51:18,900
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1281
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,400
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE].

1282
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,400


1283
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,730
So I'm trying to understand the
structure of the micro-network

1284
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:32,830
and just what a
border actually is.

1285
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,194
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

1286
00:51:34,194 --> 00:51:36,787
Let me see if I can pull
up a quick diagram for you.

1287
00:51:36,787 --> 00:51:37,745
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

1288
00:51:37,745 --> 00:51:39,944


1289
00:51:39,944 --> 00:51:41,110
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's right.

1290
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:41,610
Yeah.

1291
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,780
It's a video camera, it's not--

1292
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:58,680
So MIT really has three
border routers, external 1,

1293
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,820
external 2, and another router.

1294
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,380
Let's just call it external 3.

1295
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,380
So these are our--

1296
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:14,610


1297
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:18,300
so basically, the actual mit.net
is pretty much a standard hub

1298
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,340
and spoke topology.

1299
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:23,170
We have core switches connected
out to a distribution layer.

1300
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:25,930
And then they go out
to access layers,

1301
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:27,600
which are basically buildings.

1302
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,645
At the border, we have
these three borders here.

1303
00:52:29,645 --> 00:52:32,420


1304
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,470
This is incredibly vague.

1305
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,170
I apologize.

1306
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:37,600
But we have multiple providers.

1307
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,550
So for instance, our
commercial providers

1308
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:43,320
will soon be dual home to
both of our border routers.

1309
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,990
This external router 3 here--

1310
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,820


1311
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:50,660
which is not its real name--
but this external router here

1312
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,440
is basically for
research peering.

1313
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,820
So we kind of have a
delineation between commodity

1314
00:52:56,820 --> 00:53:00,070
and commercial peering
and research peering.

1315
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,170
So all of the BGP
we're talking about

1316
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,700
happens between the external
border and our providers

1317
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,900
and back up into
the internet itself.

1318
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,820


1319
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:14,680
Oh, and these are just
choke point routers

1320
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,120
that we have between
our border and our core.

1321
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:21,690


1322
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:22,190
OK.

1323
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:27,910
So in response to the
Swartz tragedy of--

1324
00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:32,260
I believe it was two years
ago, I had just started here--

1325
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,010
certain hactivists
took it upon themselves

1326
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,560
to attack MIT as an institution.

1327
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,387
So we experienced three attacks.

1328
00:53:37,387 --> 00:53:38,970
And I'm going to go
through all three,

1329
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,466
because there were three
separate and distinct types

1330
00:53:42,466 --> 00:53:42,965
of attacks.

1331
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:45,940


1332
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:49,460
So the first attack was against
our infrastructure itself.

1333
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:55,810
So at the time, MIT did and
does and will support openness.

1334
00:53:55,810 --> 00:53:59,240
And we have a very open network,
especially in comparison

1335
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:04,690
to other dot edus, having
come from another one.

1336
00:54:04,690 --> 00:54:07,269
That can be a blessing and
a curse from a security

1337
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:08,060
perspective, right?

1338
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:10,070
So we're open to the world.

1339
00:54:10,070 --> 00:54:12,970
In this case, our border
routers, these guys here

1340
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,470
that we just drew, were running
an older version of software

1341
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:20,770
that was vulnerable to a
particular denial of service

1342
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:22,000
attack.

1343
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,100
So the attackers in this case
sent a very low bandwidth

1344
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,800
stream.

1345
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,470
I mean, it was really low.

1346
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,610
It was less than 100k.

1347
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:30,890
It would have been
totally non-noticeable,

1348
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,200
without actually going on
the device and debugging.

1349
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,010
They send it to the management
interface of those devices.

1350
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,860
And those devices promptly
just keeled over, right?

1351
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,470
They didn't die,
but the CPU spiked.

1352
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:41,840
They weren't routing packets.

1353
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,920
mit.net, at that
point, was offline.

1354
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,680
So in this case, this was the
first attack we experienced.

1355
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,532
I think it was during the
Patriots playoff game.

1356
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:53,990
Sometimes, I think
these things are

1357
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,610
planned to find it when staff
is not paying attention.

1358
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,130
So it was during
that playoff game.

1359
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:02,720
What we ended up
doing was immediately

1360
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,845
upgrading the software to
a patched version, right?

1361
00:55:04,845 --> 00:55:07,550
That was a quick triage fix.

1362
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:10,824
The longer term fix was that--

1363
00:55:10,824 --> 00:55:12,240
outsiders on the
internet probably

1364
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,680
don't need to access our
management interfaces, right?

1365
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,860
A very select few need to
access those interfaces.

1366
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:22,400
So we ended up
implementing, basically,

1367
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,420
the least privileged,
so that only at the IP

1368
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,010
addresses of our staff
on VPN could access them.

1369
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:33,190
And we stopped using clear
text management protocols.

1370
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:36,330
So that one was fixed.

1371
00:55:36,330 --> 00:55:37,836
Then attack two came in.

1372
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:39,502
PROFESSOR: There's a
question over here.

1373
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:39,886
PROFESSOR: Oh, a question.

1374
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:40,468
Sorry.

1375
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:44,010
AUDIENCE: So is it not correct
that this was a zero-day attack

1376
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:45,300
against the service provider?

1377
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,540
PROFESSOR: I think it
would be fair to say

1378
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:47,770
it was not a zero-day attack.

1379
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,960


1380
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,700
The second attack was
against web.mit.edu itself.

1381
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:59,206
And this was what I alluded
to on the DNS mitigation slide

1382
00:55:59,206 --> 00:56:00,910
that I got ahead of myself on.

1383
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:05,850
So web.mit was in
our data center,

1384
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:07,010
protected by a firewall.

1385
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:08,570
So it was behind a firewall.

1386
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:11,300
What ended up happening
was that the attacker

1387
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:14,820
sent a flood of HTTP traffic.

1388
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:16,540
It was a GET and POST flood.

1389
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,800
I'm not sure which one it was.

1390
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,795
But basically, they didn't
kill the web server,

1391
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,580
they killed the firewall.

1392
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:27,060
The firewall keeled over
because firewalls too are

1393
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:28,710
a blessing and a curse, right?

1394
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:33,465
A stateless router access list
is very simple, is very fast,

1395
00:56:33,465 --> 00:56:35,215
but you also lose a
lot of the granularity

1396
00:56:35,215 --> 00:56:36,700
in what you can filter.

1397
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,325
Because it's doing
it packet by packet,

1398
00:56:38,325 --> 00:56:41,150
you can only use the criteria
in each packet, ports, and IP

1399
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,250
addresses, mostly.

1400
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:47,220
We hid behind a firewall, which
worked well when it worked.

1401
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:49,310
But when it came
under load, the state

1402
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:50,515
required of the firewall--

1403
00:56:50,515 --> 00:56:52,973
because of firewall tracking
in every state, in addition to

1404
00:56:52,973 --> 00:56:54,115
the packets--

1405
00:56:54,115 --> 00:56:55,920
it died.

1406
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,310
So the triage fix
for this attack

1407
00:56:59,310 --> 00:57:02,090
was that we moved it
to a routed network.

1408
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,840
And that's something we would
have preferred not to do,

1409
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,080
but you really had to, due to
the attack that was ongoing.

1410
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,410
The longer term mitigation
that we performed

1411
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:13,420
was that we moved
into the Akamai CDN.

1412
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,860
So you may notice, if
you go outside of MIT,

1413
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:21,110
as you go to web.mit now, it
doesn't resolve to 18.09.22

1414
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:21,610
anymore.

1415
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,060
It resolves to a C name,
which in turn resolves

1416
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:26,856
to an Akamai IP address.

1417
00:57:26,856 --> 00:57:30,670


1418
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:34,630
And attack number
three, this one actually

1419
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:38,180
wasn't on the side of mit.net.

1420
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:40,180
This was on the side
of our registrar.

1421
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:44,760
So we found the
homepage of MIT--

1422
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,350
www.mit and web.mit replaced
with this page here.

1423
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,660
And we quickly did some
diagnostics on the web server.

1424
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:53,010
Everything looked fine.

1425
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,660
The server was not compromised.

1426
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,130
It was not defaced like this.

1427
00:57:57,130 --> 00:58:00,180
And what we did
end up finding was

1428
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:05,380
that our who is information
for our name and our actual DNS

1429
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,590
delegations weren't working.

1430
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,000
So in this case, you can see
the administrative contact,

1431
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,550
"I got owned."

1432
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:17,710
And then our address, "Owned
network operations, Destroyed,

1433
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,060
Massachusetts."

1434
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,466
They were clearly just
trying to poke at us.

1435
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:24,340
But it was delegated
out to these two servers

1436
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,778
at CloudFlare, which is a
cloud-based hosting provider.

1437
00:58:26,778 --> 00:58:30,770


1438
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:33,220
So this is what
I call the troll.

1439
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,570
This was on Gizmodo.

1440
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:38,700
This was a bit of indirection
on the part of the attackers,

1441
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,792
however many there were.

1442
00:58:40,792 --> 00:58:42,000
The hack went down like this.

1443
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,510
So this is what
he told the world

1444
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:45,210
very soon after this happened.

1445
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:48,080
So once we realize
that it wasn't

1446
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:51,030
MIT or anything on
mit.net that was hacked,

1447
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,270
it was actually our
registrar, we got in contact

1448
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:53,805
with our registrar.

1449
00:58:53,805 --> 00:58:54,929
We got our records changed.

1450
00:58:54,929 --> 00:58:56,690
We got everything locked down.

1451
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:00,250
But of course, in DNS, there's
time to live values involved.

1452
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,570
Some of them are hours.

1453
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,410
So after this
attack was resolved,

1454
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:06,660
there were still
some flux afterwards.

1455
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,790
And during that time, we're
trying to clean everything up,

1456
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:12,080
he posts on Gizmodo
in the comments

1457
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,630
on an article about this.

1458
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:17,760
"Own the MIT NOC guy
with a browser exploit."

1459
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,220
That guy.

1460
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:23,570
"Get their Educause
logins, which were blah."

1461
00:59:23,570 --> 00:59:27,560
So he goes through
the whole scenario.

1462
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,120
But the vector here
was the MIT NOC guy.

1463
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,037
So Mark is swearing at
the time, up and down--

1464
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:35,536
not actually
swearing-- but swearing

1465
00:59:35,536 --> 00:59:36,890
up and down that it's not him.

1466
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:39,660
He's not compromised.

1467
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:44,050
So what we did end up finding
out after the fact was this

1468
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:46,331
was published well
after the incident.

1469
00:59:46,331 --> 00:59:48,580
That link is still live, if
you want to read about it.

1470
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:51,050
This was indirection.

1471
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,260
It wasn't true.

1472
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:55,640
The actual vector was that our
entire registrar was owned.

1473
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,160
Our registrar, being .edu, is
run by an organization called

1474
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:01,180
Educause.

1475
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,520
Turns out that every
DNS registration

1476
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,970
account had been compromised.

1477
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:08,040
The attacker had this for
I don't know how long,

1478
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,590
but they just decided to show
their hand with the MIT hack

1479
01:00:11,590 --> 01:00:14,600
here and actually use their
power to expose themselves,

1480
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,630
but to also hack our DNS.

1481
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:20,220
So this one wasn't
actually anybody

1482
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,780
at MIT's fault, it was on
the part of our registrar,

1483
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,860
which they soon acknowledged.

1484
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,810
This was in February of 2013.

1485
01:00:28,810 --> 01:00:31,275
They mentioned that they
were in fact breached.

1486
01:00:31,275 --> 01:00:32,900
And we all had to
change our passwords.

1487
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,400
And do we have two-factor now?

1488
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,400
PROFESSOR: No.

1489
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,400
PROFESSOR: OK.

1490
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,740
But we ended up locking
down our domain account so

1491
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,580
that it couldn't be changed.

1492
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,996
But you know, it turns out,
if the entire system is owned,

1493
01:00:43,996 --> 01:00:45,660
if you check a box
that says, "locked,"

1494
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,300
which prevents people
from updating it,

1495
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,530
it doesn't do much good.

1496
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:51,880
In any case, they've
fixed their system.

1497
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,910
And this one wasn't
our fault, but it

1498
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:55,910
was kind of an interesting
one because it really

1499
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:58,090
subverted some of the core
protocols of the internet

1500
01:00:58,090 --> 01:01:00,849
in order to do this.

1501
01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:03,687
OK, so the current
threat landscape.

1502
01:01:03,687 --> 01:01:04,633
No, no, no.

1503
01:01:04,633 --> 01:01:06,052
[INAUDIBLE]

1504
01:01:06,052 --> 01:01:07,950
Ah.

1505
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,920
So if you can't exploit the
silicon, exploit the carbon.

1506
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,990
Exploit the use at the keyboard.

1507
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:18,091
And this is what we're
seeing a lot of now.

1508
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,590
I mean, from my
personal experience,

1509
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:22,530
having been in this
for almost 20 years,

1510
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,477
the network-based vector--

1511
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:27,060
with the exception
of this year, which

1512
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,120
I'll talk about in a minute--
but the network-based vector,

1513
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,661
attacks that originate
on the network

1514
01:01:30,661 --> 01:01:33,180
and remotely exploit
hosts, that isn't

1515
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,620
a lot of what we see anymore.

1516
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,700
Computer systems actually do
seem to be getting more secure,

1517
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:40,185
from the outside at least.

1518
01:01:40,185 --> 01:01:43,510
You know, Windows, and Solaris,
and Linux, in the old days,

1519
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:46,190
maybe a decade ago, they used
to ship with all their services

1520
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:46,782
enable.

1521
01:01:46,782 --> 01:01:48,490
I called it lit up
like a Christmas tree.

1522
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:53,520
Everything would be on, because
on the convenience and security

1523
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,090
continuum--

1524
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:56,965
if we agree that one exists,
some people don't-- but they

1525
01:01:56,965 --> 01:01:58,530
were way on the convenient side.

1526
01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,160
They wanted everything
to work out of the box.

1527
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,170
Whereas, I think we
found a sensible medium

1528
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,050
where, when you install
a fresh operating system,

1529
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:09,350
there is a host-based
firewall running.

1530
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:13,170
And there aren't world
accessible services

1531
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:14,340
running on a system.

1532
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:17,320
We've also got things like
Windows Update and Apple Update

1533
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,070
and package managers in
all the Linux distros,

1534
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,280
so that a box that gets
online, pretty quickly,

1535
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,552
will get itself up to date.

1536
01:02:24,552 --> 01:02:27,010
So you don't have these ancient
boxes with ancient services

1537
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,660
open to the world.

1538
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:29,160
OK.

1539
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,090
So where I was going
with that is they've

1540
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,312
moved up the stack now, right?

1541
01:02:34,312 --> 01:02:36,020
Maybe they're at level
eight or nine now.

1542
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,186
They're dealing with people.

1543
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:41,680
And they're trying to exploit
human failings or frailties,

1544
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,950
like fear, or greed, or
trust, or familiarity, to kind

1545
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:49,220
of leverage credentials, so that
they can exploit application

1546
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:50,720
access or privileged access.

1547
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,640
Rather than exploiting
hosts themselves,

1548
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,410
they're exploiting people.

1549
01:02:56,410 --> 01:03:01,190
A few things we've seen on
campus in the very recent past.

1550
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:02,780
This one here--
oh, I should say,

1551
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:04,800
we have not experienced
this one on campus.

1552
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:06,660
I don't want to scare anybody.

1553
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:09,550
This has been seen, though,
across the nation in different

1554
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:10,174
.edus.

1555
01:03:10,174 --> 01:03:11,840
And it's a very serious
threat, so we're

1556
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,270
moving quickly to address it.

1557
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:15,490
However, we have not
actually seen it here.

1558
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:18,089
So this threat is
spear phishing.

1559
01:03:18,089 --> 01:03:20,130
And this is probably
remedial, but spear phishing

1560
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,650
targets a particular community
with a plausible message.

1561
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:26,620
So if you just get spam
messages or phishing messages,

1562
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:30,420
they're just casting a
wide net and catching

1563
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:34,940
people who, for some bizarre
reason, might respond to that.

1564
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:37,765
However, in a spear
phishing attack,

1565
01:03:37,765 --> 01:03:40,610
if they're able to narrow it and
find a community of interest,

1566
01:03:40,610 --> 01:03:43,690
that they can actually say
something that sounds mildly

1567
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:45,640
plausible, Bank of
America customers,

1568
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:47,420
or MIT students,
staff, and faculty.

1569
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,420


1570
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,140
In this case, they were
able to choose communities

1571
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:55,012
of different institutions.

1572
01:03:55,012 --> 01:03:56,970
I'm not singling anybody
out, but it is public.

1573
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,760
And Boston University
was one of them.

1574
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:04,950
They targeted the community with
bogus email messages pointing

1575
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:06,870
to a bogus authentication site.

1576
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:09,179
Some percentage of the users
actually clicked through

1577
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,220
and logged in, which of
course, gave the attacker

1578
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,480
the credentials.

1579
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,800
The attacker then went
to the legitimate site

1580
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,645
and redirected those
user's direct deposits

1581
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,790
to an account
under their control

1582
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,660
and emptied that account.

1583
01:04:22,660 --> 01:04:26,080
I'm not sure the dollars
affected there are public,

1584
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,140
but it was probably
a large amount.

1585
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,970
So in response to this--

1586
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,510
I mean, how do you combat that?

1587
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:37,110
To a large extent, it's a
user education issue, so

1588
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:38,150
community awareness.

1589
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:41,180
Just let people know
you can't trust email.

1590
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:44,720
You just have to verify things,
before you click on them.

1591
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:49,681
But from experience and
just knowing human nature,

1592
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:51,180
that's only going
to get you so far.

1593
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,490
There's always going to be
some percentage of people

1594
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:53,540
who click on it.

1595
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,530
And I'm amazed.

1596
01:04:55,530 --> 01:04:57,670
As you can imagine-- you
all probably are as well--

1597
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:59,544
I'm a repository of all
the phishing messages

1598
01:04:59,544 --> 01:05:00,590
my family receives.

1599
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:03,880
So I'm getting stuff from
my father, my sister, like,

1600
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:04,730
is this legit?

1601
01:05:04,730 --> 01:05:06,695
And it's getting
increasingly hard to tell.

1602
01:05:06,695 --> 01:05:08,570
So you've got to actually
go into the headers

1603
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:09,861
and see where it's coming from.

1604
01:05:09,861 --> 01:05:12,470


1605
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:13,940
And a lot of male
clients now, they

1606
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:15,606
don't actually like
to show you the link

1607
01:05:15,606 --> 01:05:18,690
that it points to, which
gets really annoying.

1608
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:19,800
So it's getting harder.

1609
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:24,800
So some of it is
just user error,

1610
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:25,940
for lack of a better word.

1611
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,690
And some of it is it's just
increasingly difficult to tell.

1612
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:31,630
So at the root of the
problem, in my opinion,

1613
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:34,526
is that passwords are just
a dead technology, right?

1614
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:37,025
In terms of the factors, it's
something you know a password,

1615
01:05:37,025 --> 01:05:39,240
it's something you
are, maybe a biometric,

1616
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,840
or something you have, a token.

1617
01:05:42,840 --> 01:05:46,120
So what we're doing to try
to mitigate this here--

1618
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,650
because basically, these
man-in-the-middle attacks are

1619
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,330
just stealing
something you know.

1620
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:51,780
They're stealing your password.

1621
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,084
Well, if we can also add
something that you have,

1622
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:57,000
that attack is only going
to get them halfway.

1623
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,150
They're not going to be able
to compromise your identity.

1624
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:02,430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] number?

1625
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,648
PROFESSOR: You won't
be able to compromise--

1626
01:06:04,648 --> 01:06:06,314
the attacker won't
be able to compromise

1627
01:06:06,314 --> 01:06:07,910
the identity of the user.

1628
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:11,720
So we are rolling out a
second authentication factor

1629
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:18,380
in the near term that will be
tied into our Touchstone IDP.

1630
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:20,150
We can release that
to these guys, right?

1631
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,440
So early release, if
you're interested.

1632
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:28,217
If you're go to duo.mit.edu,
we're using a vendor

1633
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,050
called Duo Security.

1634
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:32,640
It's a cloud-based two-factor
authentication system that's

1635
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,330
being used in a lot of edus.

1636
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:37,750
But basically, you'll register
your phone as a second factor

1637
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:39,530
and you run a little
smartphone app.

1638
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:41,960
If you don't have a
smartphone, I'm sorry.

1639
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:47,980
But if you don't have one,
you can also do it via SMS.

1640
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,090
It will actually call you
and tell you a number.

1641
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:58,930
And you can also generate
one-time passwords,

1642
01:06:58,930 --> 01:07:01,240
a list of 10 passwords
that you can use.

1643
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,150
So this is coming
soon to the community.

1644
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:06,020
It is completely active at this
point, it's just not announced.

1645
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:08,640
If you want to go to duo.mit,
you can opt your phone in.

1646
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,870
You can actually
turn on Touchstone.

1647
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:15,690
I'll give you a quick demo,
to show you how it integrates.

1648
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:19,870
The beauty of using standards
and federated systems,

1649
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:23,260
like SAML and Shibboleth,
which underlay Touchstone,

1650
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:28,020
is that we can easily lay
on additional factors.

1651
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:33,240
So in this case, I'm going to
just go to a tool that I use,

1652
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:37,010
which is transparently going
to authenticate me using

1653
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:38,390
Touchstone with my certificate.

1654
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:39,980
But I should now
get prompted for--

1655
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:44,625


1656
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:45,250
too fast there.

1657
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:52,881


1658
01:07:52,881 --> 01:07:53,631
Who runs this now?

1659
01:07:53,631 --> 01:07:56,589


1660
01:07:56,589 --> 01:07:58,054
PROFESSOR: Don't know that guy.

1661
01:07:58,054 --> 01:07:59,054
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

1662
01:07:59,054 --> 01:07:59,554
[LAUGHTER]

1663
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:00,554
PROFESSOR: He got owned.

1664
01:08:00,554 --> 01:08:01,519
[LAUGHTER]

1665
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:02,185
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1666
01:08:02,185 --> 01:08:03,560
PROFESSOR: Give
me a site to hit.

1667
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,020
I'm just drawing a
blank, because I'm

1668
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:05,560
in front of a crowd.

1669
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:06,310
PROFESSOR: Splunk?

1670
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:07,290
PROFESSOR: Splunk.

1671
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:08,760
No, not Splunk.

1672
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,060
Because that's not a native
Touchstone integration.

1673
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:12,780
Atlas.

1674
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:13,738
PROFESSOR: Atlas, yeah.

1675
01:08:13,738 --> 01:08:25,956


1676
01:08:25,956 --> 01:08:27,033
[LAUGHTER]

1677
01:08:27,033 --> 01:08:27,908
PROFESSOR: All right.

1678
01:08:27,908 --> 01:08:28,408
All right.

1679
01:08:28,408 --> 01:08:30,533
PROFESSOR: Well, he's very
secure, at least, right?

1680
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:31,460
[LAUGHTER]

1681
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:33,585
The only real security is
to stay off the internet.

1682
01:08:33,585 --> 01:08:36,904


1683
01:08:36,904 --> 01:08:37,779
PROFESSOR: All right.

1684
01:08:37,779 --> 01:08:43,349
If this doesn't work in 20
seconds, I will move on.

1685
01:08:43,349 --> 01:08:45,890
PROFESSOR: Do you have another
browser, maybe, that's cached?

1686
01:08:45,890 --> 01:08:46,598
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

1687
01:08:46,598 --> 01:08:53,580


1688
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:54,130
There we go.

1689
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:54,630
Oh, weird.

1690
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,064
OK, so here's my typical
Touchstone login.

1691
01:08:57,064 --> 01:09:00,119


1692
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:02,055
Now, you're going to
just get one more prompt.

1693
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:05,700


1694
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,566
PROFESSOR: You're actually
off the Wi-Fi, it looks like.

1695
01:09:08,566 --> 01:09:09,399
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

1696
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:09,899
I did.

1697
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:17,166


1698
01:09:17,166 --> 01:09:17,666
All right.

1699
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:19,499
Well, let's leave that
demo for after class,

1700
01:09:19,499 --> 01:09:21,870
and let's edit that out.

1701
01:09:21,870 --> 01:09:23,490
[LAUGHTER]

1702
01:09:23,490 --> 01:09:24,990
PROFESSOR: In fact,
now I tried it--

1703
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:25,080
PROFESSOR: All right.

1704
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:27,203
I did not rehearse that
demo, so that's what I get.

1705
01:09:27,203 --> 01:09:28,789
But trust me, it works.

1706
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:31,850
If you go to Duo, you
can register yourself.

1707
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:34,924
And all of your two-factor
interactions-- or I'm sorry,

1708
01:09:34,924 --> 01:09:37,340
your Touchstone interactions
will all be two-factored now.

1709
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,270
And you'll be super secure.

1710
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:41,450
It really does work well.

1711
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:47,120
Another threat we've experienced
in the past few months is--

1712
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,850
this, again, is something
that's targeting not just edus,

1713
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:52,630
but organizations
across the country.

1714
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:55,040
But we've been getting
police called ID spoofing.

1715
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,850
And this kind of transcends
the digital world,

1716
01:09:57,850 --> 01:09:59,474
for the most part.

1717
01:09:59,474 --> 01:10:01,140
Members of the MIT
community are getting

1718
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:03,720
calls from local
police departments

1719
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,284
nearby their hometown.

1720
01:10:05,284 --> 01:10:05,950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1721
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:07,110
It appears to be a call.

1722
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:08,280
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1723
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:12,205
So these police departments are
telling them bad news, right?

1724
01:10:12,205 --> 01:10:13,830
They're telling them
you're about to be

1725
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:14,890
charged with a crime.

1726
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:16,900
I think some of
them are tax fraud.

1727
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:19,160
Your family member's
been in an accident.

1728
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,740
Of course, it's not real.

1729
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:23,600
Their call's coming
from an attacker who's

1730
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:26,573
using ANI, which is automated--

1731
01:10:26,573 --> 01:10:28,545
PROFESSOR: They're
using SIP, basically,

1732
01:10:28,545 --> 01:10:31,037
to forge their From field
in their voice call, right?

1733
01:10:31,037 --> 01:10:31,620
PROFESSOR: OK.

1734
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:32,746
Which feeds into caller ID.

1735
01:10:32,746 --> 01:10:34,286
PROFESSOR: Which
then gets translated

1736
01:10:34,286 --> 01:10:36,850
by a bridge who trust the From
field that a SIP message to be

1737
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:38,141
whatever number's placed in it.

1738
01:10:38,141 --> 01:10:38,770
PROFESSOR: OK.

1739
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:41,617
PROFESSOR: And so the attacker's
like, all right, so I sign up

1740
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:42,700
for a cheapie SIP service.

1741
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:45,170
And I'll set my From field
to be the police department's

1742
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:46,590
number in Lexington.

1743
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:47,480
And I'll send it.

1744
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:49,560
And once it gets to the
transcoding gateway that

1745
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:51,780
turns it back into traditional
telephony, it says, all right.

1746
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,196
Well, that's the
number it's from.

1747
01:10:53,196 --> 01:10:55,235
We'll just show it to the
user when it shows up.

1748
01:10:55,235 --> 01:10:56,860
PROFESSOR: So you
end up getting a call

1749
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:59,235
from what you think is a police
department with extremely

1750
01:10:59,235 --> 01:11:00,300
bad news.

1751
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:02,390
Again, they're exploiting
human frailty here.

1752
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:04,210
In this case, it's
probably fear.

1753
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:06,540
Maybe it's a little
anger, but it's the case--

1754
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:07,410
PROFESSOR: Or guilt.

1755
01:11:07,410 --> 01:11:08,060
PROFESSOR: What's that?

1756
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:08,480
PROFESSOR: Or guilt.

1757
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:09,146
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1758
01:11:09,146 --> 01:11:10,010
Yeah, I suppose.

1759
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:12,680
[LAUGHS] If it's legit.

1760
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,730
But in any case, these calls all
come to the same point, which

1761
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:21,242
is you need to pay a fee for
something, which, on its face

1762
01:11:21,242 --> 01:11:21,950
is kind of bogus.

1763
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:23,180
But once they've told you this--

1764
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:25,260
I mean, if they told me that
my wife was in a car accident,

1765
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:27,010
I would not be in the
right state of mind.

1766
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:28,630
And I might believe
some craziness

1767
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:30,400
that they tell me
after the fact.

1768
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:35,930
So we've had people
on campus who--

1769
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:38,420
I don't think it's actually
anyone's actually paid,

1770
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,940
but we have had multiple
targets of this attack.

1771
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:42,569
And again, this isn't just here.

1772
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:44,360
If you Google it, you'll
find reports of it

1773
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,637
in Pittsburgh newspapers
and all over the country.

1774
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,720
But again, this is a spear
phishing attack, right?

1775
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,510
They figure out where you live.

1776
01:11:51,510 --> 01:11:53,520
And they can do this by
just Googling your name

1777
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:56,920
or just looking at MIT
and checking the directory

1778
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,080
and finding out some
details about you.

1779
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,940
And they just need
enough to be plausible.

1780
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:03,740
And then they proceed to call
you and scare you and try

1781
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,890
to extort you.

1782
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,969
The mitigation
here is difficult,

1783
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:09,510
because it involves
the phone system.

1784
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:11,992
It involves multiple bridges.

1785
01:12:11,992 --> 01:12:13,450
Frankly, I'm not
a phone guy, so it

1786
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:16,700
involves lots of stuff I'm just
going to wave my hands about.

1787
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,432
But law enforcement needs
to be involved here.

1788
01:12:19,432 --> 01:12:22,015
You have to go to your providers
and work with law enforcement

1789
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:23,090
to get that traced back.

1790
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,842


1791
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:26,800
Actually moved forward?

1792
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:33,067
And one more along the spear
phishing email side of things.

1793
01:12:33,067 --> 01:12:34,650
There's another thing
that some people

1794
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,720
call whaling, which is
the intentional targeting

1795
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:38,344
of high level staff
at an organization.

1796
01:12:38,344 --> 01:12:41,280


1797
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,790
We have experienced this--

1798
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:45,373
I've experienced it elsewhere,
but we've also experienced this

1799
01:12:45,373 --> 01:12:48,110
here where they will send
extremely targeted messages

1800
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:51,620
at high level staff,
using org charts,

1801
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:54,420
using directories to
find plausible reporting

1802
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:59,830
relationships, and write some
really believable messages

1803
01:12:59,830 --> 01:13:02,107
that, if you're not careful
when you click reply,

1804
01:13:02,107 --> 01:13:03,690
that wire transfer
number that they're

1805
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:05,790
asking for isn't going to
the person that you think

1806
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:06,498
sent the message.

1807
01:13:06,498 --> 01:13:09,660
It's going to somewhere on
the other side of the world

1808
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:11,470
or the other side
of the country.

1809
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:13,544
So we've been
experiencing this as well.

1810
01:13:13,544 --> 01:13:16,210
The short of it is-- in your own
security class, you know this--

1811
01:13:16,210 --> 01:13:18,090
SMTP is not a reliable protocol.

1812
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:19,960
You can't believe
pretty much anything

1813
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:23,150
in there, which just
runs completely counter

1814
01:13:23,150 --> 01:13:23,900
to human nature.

1815
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,302
So take everything
with a grain of salt.

1816
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:28,926
PROFESSOR: You going
to tell the story?

1817
01:13:28,926 --> 01:13:29,884
PROFESSOR: No, you can.

1818
01:13:29,884 --> 01:13:31,782
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1819
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:32,740
Yeah.

1820
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:34,320
So you could tell it.

1821
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,810
Basically, we had one recently.

1822
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:38,360
And I won't go into the
details or the names.

1823
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:39,577
Keep anonymity.

1824
01:13:39,577 --> 01:13:44,040
But a senior member
of the administration

1825
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:49,180
reaches out and says,
hey, I got this email.

1826
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,800
This is from someone
and says, I need

1827
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:55,270
help-- a very senior executive--
with a wire transfer.

1828
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,640
And so he sent me this email.

1829
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,450
And I replied.

1830
01:13:57,450 --> 01:14:00,820
And he said he didn't know
what I was talking about.

1831
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:01,990
And so how did that happen?

1832
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:03,180
Is my email account hacked?

1833
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:06,410
It says I sent this
email, but I didn't.

1834
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:10,140
And to Dave's point, the whole
possibility that email itself

1835
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,794
could somehow be spoofed,
without your account itself

1836
01:14:12,794 --> 01:14:14,960
being compromised, is very
foreign to people, right?

1837
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:16,270
It's a trust relationship.

1838
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:17,970
So it turns out, I
guess, it was someone

1839
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:22,485
at an internet cafe in Nigeria
or something like that,

1840
01:14:22,485 --> 01:14:23,610
which we were joking about.

1841
01:14:23,610 --> 01:14:25,735
But yeah, they basically
went to the MIT org chart,

1842
01:14:25,735 --> 01:14:27,520
found a senior
executive, found someone

1843
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,770
in the Vice President of
Finance office and said, hey,

1844
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,894
I need you to help me with
this wire transfer call.

1845
01:14:31,894 --> 01:14:32,760
Here's the number.

1846
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,510
And these are the kinds of
things that happen every day.

1847
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:38,450
They didn't transfer
the money, obviously.

1848
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:39,520
PROFESSOR: The email
was totally believable?

1849
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:39,780
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1850
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:40,980
PROFESSOR: I've seen it.

1851
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:41,830
PROFESSOR: Even the
tone and everything

1852
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:42,810
seemed very plausible.

1853
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:42,845
PROFESSOR: Yep.

1854
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:44,678
PROFESSOR: They actually
used email messages

1855
01:14:44,678 --> 01:14:46,590
this senior
executive had written

1856
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:48,174
that were posted
on public websites,

1857
01:14:48,174 --> 01:14:49,840
because they send
memos to the community

1858
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,760
and things like that that
used the exact same style,

1859
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:56,200
introduction, the way
they closed the message.

1860
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,055
Even the language and terms
they used was identical.

1861
01:14:59,055 --> 01:15:01,214
This is stuff they had
used in other ways.

1862
01:15:01,214 --> 01:15:02,630
So it was actually
kind of creepy,

1863
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:04,046
because even when
I first read it,

1864
01:15:04,046 --> 01:15:07,060
if you didn't know what it
was, it was semi-plausible.

1865
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,310
And thankfully, the staff
member that it was requested

1866
01:15:09,310 --> 01:15:11,910
of-- like this was kind of an
out of the ordinary request,

1867
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:14,180
it got flagged, even though
it looked legitimate.

1868
01:15:14,180 --> 01:15:19,530
And he or she responded
directly to the sender,

1869
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,300
removing the Reply To
address and actually

1870
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,170
putting in a known good one from
his address book or her address

1871
01:15:25,170 --> 01:15:29,377
book, and responded and
asked and kind of unveiled

1872
01:15:29,377 --> 01:15:30,270
the whole scheme.

1873
01:15:30,270 --> 01:15:34,620
But it could have gone
south really quickly.

1874
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,620
OK, so I mentioned that
the network-based vector

1875
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,310
in my experience isn't as
prevalent as it used to be.

1876
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:43,900
And I'll kind of belie that
here, or make a lie of it here.

1877
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:47,390
This year has been a
year of major exploits.

1878
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:50,320
Every single major
SSL implementation

1879
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,630
has been targeted.

1880
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:55,120
There was Schannel on
the Microsoft side.

1881
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:59,190
There was the Apple
implementation, open SSL.

1882
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:00,640
There was Poodle with SSL v3.

1883
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:04,179


1884
01:16:04,179 --> 01:16:04,970
This is SSL, right?

1885
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:06,220
This is a security service.

1886
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:09,770
So when you put a service
up facing the world,

1887
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,240
you're going to run SSL.

1888
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:13,360
So we had a lot of
world-facing services

1889
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,220
out there that were vulnerable
to some of these things.

1890
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,990
Shellshock was one that affected
the Bash shell where you could

1891
01:16:19,990 --> 01:16:21,680
remotely exploit a system.

1892
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:24,730
So these are all kind
of the gold standard

1893
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:26,644
of a network-based exploit.

1894
01:16:26,644 --> 01:16:28,560
They were remotely
exploitable, and they could

1895
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,330
get administrative privileges.

1896
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,400
So it's been a kind of a
nasty year, in terms of that.

1897
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,560
So it's, in my opinion,
a bit of an outlier.

1898
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:38,970
But how do we deal with this?

1899
01:16:38,970 --> 01:16:40,780
Because these
services are public.

1900
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:41,840
They need to be public.

1901
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,800
We can't just fence them
off, because they're

1902
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:46,040
vulnerable to something.

1903
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:49,640
The first thing is
automatic patching.

1904
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,875
In the old days, the latency
between a zero day coming out

1905
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,500
and a patch coming
out was fairly long.

1906
01:16:54,500 --> 01:16:56,583
That's shortening, and
shortening, and shortening,

1907
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,572
so we're down to
literally hours.

1908
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,030
So when these things
surface, we're

1909
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:02,029
able to push out updates
to at least the systems

1910
01:17:02,029 --> 01:17:03,370
that we maintain.

1911
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,455
The systems we don't
maintain, we're

1912
01:17:05,455 --> 01:17:09,500
able to use our communication
folks, like the communications

1913
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,770
office and Monique
on the security team,

1914
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:14,410
to craft messages to go out to
the community to at least alert

1915
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:16,460
them to the fact that you
really need the patch,

1916
01:17:16,460 --> 01:17:20,030
because this is dangerous
and it's out there.

1917
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:23,800
On the more active front,
we can detect these scans.

1918
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:26,990
So the StealthWatch tool,
I mentioned way back,

1919
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,920
is a tool that pulls
NetFlow data off

1920
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,507
of our network devices.

1921
01:17:30,507 --> 01:17:32,340
And we can do some basic
heuristics on that.

1922
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,570
And if we see an
outside IP address

1923
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:37,370
talking to several
hundred MIT systems,

1924
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,780
that's probably not good.

1925
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:41,620
It could be good.

1926
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,814
And if it's good, we will
totally white list it.

1927
01:17:43,814 --> 01:17:46,230
And we've done that many, many
times for research projects

1928
01:17:46,230 --> 01:17:48,500
and just things
that are legitimate.

1929
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,440
But it's probably
not a bad posture

1930
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,980
to say, OK, if we see
that, it's probably bad.

1931
01:17:52,980 --> 01:17:54,560
Let's block it.

1932
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,230
So we actually have some
automated BGP null-routing

1933
01:17:57,230 --> 01:17:59,640
going on where we're
actually watching the flows.

1934
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,470
And if we see an
anomalous behavior,

1935
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,410
we null-route on-the-fly.

1936
01:18:03,410 --> 01:18:04,710
That runs every five minutes.

1937
01:18:04,710 --> 01:18:10,330
So as soon as a scan starts,
we cut it off at the knees.

1938
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:15,100
On a more proactive
front even than that is

1939
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,630
we will proactively scan.

1940
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:20,900
So in the case of Shellshock
and some of the earlier SSL

1941
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:23,350
vulnerabilities that
were really deadly,

1942
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,980
we actually scanned
the community

1943
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:26,950
and sent out lists
to those we had

1944
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:28,890
contact info for to
let them know, hey,

1945
01:18:28,890 --> 01:18:30,480
this IP address is
running a service.

1946
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,605
This is a known vulnerable.

1947
01:18:31,605 --> 01:18:32,352
Please patch it.

1948
01:18:32,352 --> 01:18:34,435
It's really just about
getting the information out

1949
01:18:34,435 --> 01:18:36,910
to the community as
quickly as we can.

1950
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,950
OK future trends, because
we're running short on time,

1951
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:43,500
consumerization of IT.

1952
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:47,720
I call them future trends, but
the future is now here at MIT

1953
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,410
and pretty much at any .edu.

1954
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:51,870
These are old things that
we've been dealing with.

1955
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,050
Bring your own device--

1956
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:54,740
I mean, I've owned
my own phone here

1957
01:18:54,740 --> 01:18:58,880
and at other institutions
in the edu space forever.

1958
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,866
It makes policy enforcement
really difficult,

1959
01:19:00,866 --> 01:19:02,740
because how do you
enforce policy on a device

1960
01:19:02,740 --> 01:19:04,725
that you didn't pay for
that you don't manage?

1961
01:19:04,725 --> 01:19:07,260


1962
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:10,417
Consumerization of
services, here at MIT,

1963
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,250
we have an enterprise
agreement with Dropbox

1964
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:14,760
now, so that you can
store data up on Dropbox.

1965
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:15,510
Unlimited storage.

1966
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:17,140
That's open to students, right?

1967
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:21,660
So yes, unlimited storage
on Dropbox, which is great.

1968
01:19:21,660 --> 01:19:23,340
The problems that
come along with that

1969
01:19:23,340 --> 01:19:24,780
are maybe data custody.

1970
01:19:24,780 --> 01:19:26,320
Where is that data
going to live?

1971
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:28,910
In our case, we've made sure
that jurisdiction will always

1972
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:30,050
be in the United States.

1973
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:32,500
But what happens if you're
dealing with a provider that

1974
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,640
crosses national boundaries
into areas where they

1975
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,450
have different regulations?

1976
01:19:37,450 --> 01:19:41,845
What do you do if a person
puts sensitive information up

1977
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:44,400
on that Dropbox and it gets
synced up to the cloud.

1978
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,880
And they think it just
lives in the cloud,

1979
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,330
but we know that Dropbox
syncs to the local system.

1980
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:54,670
There's a lot of issues involved
with the consumerization of IT,

1981
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,520
because the IT
department doesn't

1982
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:57,710
control the service anymore.

1983
01:19:57,710 --> 01:20:00,251
They're really just brokering
the service between the service

1984
01:20:00,251 --> 01:20:02,570
provider and the consumer.

1985
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:04,640
Third-party email providers,
kind of same thing.

1986
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,180
You might send
sensitive information

1987
01:20:06,180 --> 01:20:08,390
through an email system
that's not totally internal.

1988
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:10,660
So sensitive data might
leave the institution.

1989
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:13,240


1990
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,390
Cloud-based resources kind
of ties into that as well.

1991
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:18,600
MIT never really
had a perimeter.

1992
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,400
Neither does the rest
of the world now, right?

1993
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:23,150
If you're a small startup--

1994
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:26,530
and I'm sure you all have
many friends at startups,

1995
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,530
I do as well--

1996
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:29,660
none of them have local
resources anymore, right?

1997
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:32,540
They're using stuff that's
entirely in the cloud.

1998
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:34,570
How do you draw a
line or put a moat

1999
01:20:34,570 --> 01:20:37,000
around those resources when
they're living in Amazon Web

2000
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,310
Services, and at Salesforce.com,
and as Google Apps,

2001
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:42,180
and as Dropbox?

2002
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,390
We need to find different
ways to handle that.

2003
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,120
We have the same
data custody issues

2004
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,990
as to where that
data might live.

2005
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:51,110
We've also got authentication
and authorization issues.

2006
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:53,520
How do you make sure
that just your users

2007
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,065
are accessing those services?

2008
01:20:55,065 --> 01:20:56,440
And that's where
things like SAML

2009
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:00,380
come in, which I think MIT
is really well-positioned,

2010
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:03,510
because we have this really
robust SAML architecture.

2011
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:05,100
When we wanted to
add Dropbox, it

2012
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,141
was easy enough to add
them as a service provider

2013
01:21:07,141 --> 01:21:09,580
to our Touchstone
infrastructure.

2014
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,170
And it just worked.

2015
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:13,030
I'm sure I'm glazing
over some things,

2016
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:15,060
but you know, in
the grand scheme,

2017
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,680
standards-based and
federated systems,

2018
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,810
like SAML and
Shibboleth are really

2019
01:21:19,810 --> 01:21:23,070
life savers in a
cloud-based world.

2020
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:25,150
The internet of things,
what does that mean?

2021
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:28,310
It seems to be the
new buzzword du jour.

2022
01:21:28,310 --> 01:21:30,450
But in terms of our
experience so far,

2023
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:33,030
the internet of
things at mit.net,

2024
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:36,042
we have building management
systems all over, right?

2025
01:21:36,042 --> 01:21:37,500
These are computer
systems that are

2026
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,010
built by the fine
folks that built

2027
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:40,590
air conditioners last year.

2028
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:44,706
So they're not all that
secure, for the most part.

2029
01:21:44,706 --> 01:21:46,330
Mark had the story
about they were just

2030
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:47,830
living on public mit.net.

2031
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:49,864
They could be probed
by anyone in the world.

2032
01:21:49,864 --> 01:21:51,530
What we've started
to do-- and actually,

2033
01:21:51,530 --> 01:21:53,821
we're almost entirely done
with our building management

2034
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:54,930
systems--

2035
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:57,120
is move them onto a
different VRF, which

2036
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,100
is a Virtual Routing
and Forwarding instance,

2037
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:01,980
so that they have a completely
different forwarding path.

2038
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:03,550
And we front-end
it with a firewall.

2039
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:04,740
It's all access controlled.

2040
01:22:04,740 --> 01:22:08,260
It lives on separate physical
infrastructure in closets.

2041
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:10,100
The closets are secured.

2042
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,570
But when we move into a
internet of things world,

2043
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:14,260
this problem is just
going to multiply.

2044
01:22:14,260 --> 01:22:15,968
What happens when the
light switches have

2045
01:22:15,968 --> 01:22:19,690
IP addresses and, who knows,
my shoes have IP addresses?

2046
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,544
And it's going to get crazy.

2047
01:22:21,544 --> 01:22:22,710
So how do we deal with that?

2048
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:25,320
And frankly, I don't
have an answer quite yet.

2049
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:26,520
Many companies say they do.

2050
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:29,040
And they'll make you spend
a lot of money on solutions.

2051
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,560
But one of them I can think of
is maybe we map access policy

2052
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:33,750
down to devices,
based on 802.1X.

2053
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:36,620
So when I authenticate or
my device authenticates,

2054
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:39,059
it pulls down the
thermostat policy,

2055
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:40,850
so that it can coexist
on the same network,

2056
01:22:40,850 --> 01:22:44,840
and yet not be wide open to the
world as, say, my laptop is.

2057
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:47,207


2058
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:49,290
So with that, I realized
we're over, but are there

2059
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:49,873
any questions?

2060
01:22:49,873 --> 01:22:52,485


2061
01:22:52,485 --> 01:22:53,359
Yes.

2062
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:55,359
AUDIENCE: So there was
one page you skipped over

2063
01:22:55,359 --> 01:22:56,317
a coupld of slides ago.

2064
01:22:56,317 --> 01:22:57,637
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.

2065
01:22:57,637 --> 01:22:58,720
AUDIENCE: Campus firewall.

2066
01:22:58,720 --> 01:22:59,835
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

2067
01:22:59,835 --> 01:23:00,460
Where was this?

2068
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:02,190
AUDIENCE: I'm curious about it.

2069
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:03,520
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

2070
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,270
PROFESSOR: I swear,
it wasn't intentional.

2071
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:06,320
Oh, yeah.

2072
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:07,120
Coming soon.

2073
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,520
So this is-- do you want to
talk about it, or shall I?

2074
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:10,186
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

2075
01:23:10,186 --> 01:23:11,182
So I'll talk about it.

2076
01:23:11,182 --> 01:23:13,390
I mean, one of the things
we realized, as David said,

2077
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:18,240
is that your default posture for
things, you get it with an Xbox

2078
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:19,610
you install it today.

2079
01:23:19,610 --> 01:23:22,080
You have IP tables by default.
Install Windows machine,

2080
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,000
you have Windows host firewall.

2081
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,410
One of the things
we look at is--

2082
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:27,159
you know, you have
this internet of things

2083
01:23:27,159 --> 01:23:29,596
and this vast variety
of devices on mit.net

2084
01:23:29,596 --> 01:23:32,170
is having a more secure
posture by default,

2085
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:34,930
so that devices, by
default, may not necessarily

2086
01:23:34,930 --> 01:23:37,620
be exposed to the
entire public network.

2087
01:23:37,620 --> 01:23:39,377
And there are legitimate
reasons people

2088
01:23:39,377 --> 01:23:41,210
want to have a device
on the public network.

2089
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:41,876
And that's fine.

2090
01:23:41,876 --> 01:23:44,480
You know, one of the things
that's great about MIT is,

2091
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:47,180
if people want to do that,
you allow them to do that.

2092
01:23:47,180 --> 01:23:48,770
They can do that in
an automated way.

2093
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:49,910
They can do that by themselves.

2094
01:23:49,910 --> 01:23:51,430
They don't need to
ask a policy person.

2095
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:53,190
They don't need to do
anything like that.

2096
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,690
So what we're trying
to move towards

2097
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:58,210
is really a network topology
where, by default, people

2098
01:23:58,210 --> 01:24:00,490
will be behind some
layer of protection.

2099
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,960
If they want to go to a web
page and enroll themselves

2100
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,645
in the public internet
level of access,

2101
01:24:04,645 --> 01:24:06,436
they can do that without
talking to anyone.

2102
01:24:06,436 --> 01:24:07,690
And it's automated.

2103
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:11,154
And it just happens
within a minute or two.

2104
01:24:11,154 --> 01:24:13,070
And so I think what we're
trying to do is just

2105
01:24:13,070 --> 01:24:14,986
move the default security
posture to something

2106
01:24:14,986 --> 01:24:17,980
a little bit more secure, by
default. But at the same time,

2107
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:20,262
we recognize that
our goal here is

2108
01:24:20,262 --> 01:24:22,220
to not really disrupt
the innovative activities

2109
01:24:22,220 --> 01:24:23,190
that happen here.

2110
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:25,440
And so if people want to do
that, students or faculty,

2111
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,956
on an opt-in basis and go to
the web page, that's up to them.

2112
01:24:28,956 --> 01:24:31,790


2113
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:33,661
Any other questions?

2114
01:24:33,661 --> 01:24:34,494
AUDIENCE: I had one.

2115
01:24:34,494 --> 01:24:36,374
PROFESSOR: Sure.

2116
01:24:36,374 --> 01:24:39,750
AUDIENCE: What's the traffic
like now on the MIT network?

2117
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:42,180
It's like, what kind of
traffic do you see the most of?

2118
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:42,500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

2119
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,990
So I mean, looking
at StealthWatch,

2120
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:46,930
I'd say like 80% of our traffic,
if you look at it by protocol,

2121
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:48,930
is like HTTP, you
know, [INAUDIBLE].

2122
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:51,210
PROFESSOR: Which would
include HTTP-streamed media.

2123
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:52,300
PROFESSOR: Movies, media.

2124
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,180
Now, I think the interesting
question you could ask

2125
01:24:54,180 --> 01:24:56,300
is how much of it is
legitimate research activity.

2126
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,670
[LAUGHTER]

2127
01:24:57,670 --> 01:24:59,730
I know you guys are
all studying hard.

2128
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:01,730
I know I was, that's why
I'm still working here.

2129
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:02,230
No.

2130
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,590
But yeah, it's
interesting breakdown.

2131
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,950
I think the one thing
we do philosophically,

2132
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:08,735
as a provider, is--

2133
01:25:08,735 --> 01:25:10,110
you know, a lot
of schools, there

2134
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,485
was a time where
they were trying

2135
01:25:11,485 --> 01:25:14,450
to make judgments about
what kinds of traffic

2136
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:16,730
and how much were going
across their campus networks.

2137
01:25:16,730 --> 01:25:17,990
MIT does not do that.

2138
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:21,210
One thing we believe very
strongly in is not me

2139
01:25:21,210 --> 01:25:23,080
nor anybody else in
the administration

2140
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,310
is in a position to pass
value judgment over someone's

2141
01:25:26,310 --> 01:25:27,520
internet activity.

2142
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:28,540
PROFESSOR: Because
people live here.

2143
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,250
PROFESSOR: You live here, right?

2144
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,430
PROFESSOR: It's
not just your work.

2145
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:32,800
I mean, people are doing a
lot of research on Netflix,

2146
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,340
because we have a Netflix cache.

2147
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:35,840
And we a lot of
traffic going there.

2148
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,780
But we also have thousands of
students and staff living here.

2149
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,900
So that's them at night
powering up their Netflix box

2150
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:43,750
and streaming.

2151
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,720
PROFESSOR: Or
whatever it may be.

2152
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,510
So we've always been in the
position of like, you know, we

2153
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:48,718
have some very detailed
information about what it is.

2154
01:25:48,718 --> 01:25:51,200
But I'd say that most
of it is, I'd say,

2155
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:53,290
even nowadays, is kind of scary.

2156
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:56,550
I'd say, at night, half of
it's video stream, which is--

2157
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:58,780
AUDIENCE: Would you
allow torrent traffic?

2158
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:58,910
PROFESSOR: Porn?

2159
01:25:58,910 --> 01:25:59,620
PROFESSOR: We don't.

2160
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:00,210
No.

2161
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:00,595
AUDIENCE: Torrents.

2162
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:00,980
[INAUDIBLE]

2163
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:01,563
PROFESSOR: Oh.

2164
01:26:01,563 --> 01:26:02,910
You know what's interesting?

2165
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:06,370
So porn and torrents are
pretty similar, so yeah.

2166
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:07,027
[LAUGHTER]

2167
01:26:07,027 --> 01:26:09,360
Not that that's what went
through my head Freudian-wise.

2168
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,845
I'm sorry.

2169
01:26:10,845 --> 01:26:11,970
You know, it's interesting.

2170
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:14,245
Torrent traffic has
actually gone down.

2171
01:26:14,245 --> 01:26:15,870
I think that's what's
been interesting.

2172
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:18,180
I'd say it's actually
gone down over the years.

2173
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:21,966
I think, on the plus side,
most things are getting so easy

2174
01:26:21,966 --> 01:26:24,090
for people to get through
something like a Netflix,

2175
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:25,800
or an Amazon Prime,
or whatever it

2176
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:28,940
is, where you can
subscribe for $4 a month,

2177
01:26:28,940 --> 01:26:30,550
where people are
generally doing it.

2178
01:26:30,550 --> 01:26:32,200
We have a Comcast
video TV service

2179
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,222
we offer for free
to the students.

2180
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:36,680
If you want to do IPTV, you
can just do it on your computer

2181
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:37,319
now.

2182
01:26:37,319 --> 01:26:39,610
But for the most part, I've
seen torrents have actually

2183
01:26:39,610 --> 01:26:40,448
gone down.

2184
01:26:40,448 --> 01:26:42,614
I would just be honest,
which is kind of a surprise.

2185
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:44,785


2186
01:26:44,785 --> 01:26:45,660
PROFESSOR: All right.

2187
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:46,820
Well, let's thank Dave and Mark.

2188
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:47,420
PROFESSOR: Thank you, guys.

2189
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,295
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

2190
01:26:48,295 --> 01:26:49,570
[APPLAUSE]

2191
01:26:49,570 --> 00:00:00,000
